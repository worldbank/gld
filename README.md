# Welcome to the Global Labor Database Repository

This is repository and homepage of the Jobs Group’s Global Labor Database (GLD) at the World Bank. Here you will find all the information to understand, recreate, and edit the GLD.

The GLD aims to cover all household surveys with a labor market module worldwide, with a focus on lower income countries.

Around the harmonization the GLD team aims to create an open and collaborative ecosystem of contextual information and tools that helps users more quickly understand the data and leverage it. When it comes to working with labor microdata you should not start at square one and you shouldn’t have to travel alone: the GLD team is there to assist.

We hope, in turn, you will also contribute to GLD, from pointing out issues with our codes or concepts to proposing new harmonizations. We aim to establish a new standard of transparency and collaboration. Please feel free to navigate the website as you please though we recommend first-timers to start with the [introduction to the GLD](https://worldbank.github.io/gld/Support/A%20-%20Guides%20and%20Documentation/GLD%20Manual%20Files/Introduction%20to%20the%20GLD.html).

The Global Labor Database is proudly supported by the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Jobs Umbrella Multi-Donor Trust Fund benefactors and the WBG Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Partnership Fund (below in alphabetical order).
