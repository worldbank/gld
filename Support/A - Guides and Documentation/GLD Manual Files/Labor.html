<p><strong>minlaborage</strong></p>
<p>This is the lowest age for which the labor module is implemented in the survey or the minimum working age in the country. For this reason, the lower age cutoff at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<section id="labour-status-7-day-reference-period">
<h3>Labour status, 7-day reference period<a class="headerlink" href="#labour-status-7-day-reference-period" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>lstatus</strong></p>
<p>lstatus is an individual’s labor status in the last 7 days. The value must be missing for individuals less than the required age (minlaborage).</p>
<p>Three categories are used after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Employed</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Unemployed</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Not-in-labor force</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All persons are considered active in the labor force if they presently have a job (formal or informal, i.e., employed) or do not have a job but are actively seeking work (i.e., unemployed).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Employed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Employed is defined as anyone who worked during the last 7 days or reference week, regardless of whether the employment was formal or informal, paid or unpaid, for a minimum of 1 hour. Individuals who had a job, but for any reason did not work in the last 7 days are considered employed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 = Unemployed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A person is defined as unemployed if he or she is, presently not working but is actively seeking a job. The formal definition of unemployed usually includes being ‘able to accept a job’ (i.e., passively seeking a job). This last question is not asked in all surveys but should be included if present. A person presently not working but waiting for the start of a new job is considered unemployed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = Not-in-labor force</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A person is defined as not-in-labor force if he or she is, presently not working and it is not actively seeking a job during the last 7 days or reference week.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, a significant alteration has occurred in survey methodologies regarding the definition of employment, specifically affecting labor status. This change stems from the deliberations of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), a forum for standardization in labor statistics convened by the International Labour Organization (ILO) every five years. During the 19th session of the ICLS in 2013, delegates passed a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm">resolution pertaining to the categorization of work, employment, and labor underutilization</a>.</p>
<p>In essence, the ICLS-19 resolution redefines employment as work performed for others in exchange for pay or profit, excluding activities such as subsistence agriculture or self-housing construction, which were previously classified as employment. This revision necessitates a careful adjustment in coding practices for variables associated with labor status, such as the “lstatus” variable.</p>
<p>To ensure accurate coding, harmonizers should discern the underlying ICLS version utilized in each survey through thorough examination of questionnaire text, skip patterns, and survey reports. Consequently, harmonizers must code the “lstatus” variable in accordance with the pertinent ICLS version (and annotate the version used via the “icls_v” variable).</p>
<p>It is imperative to emphasize that each survey undergoes independent harmonization. Therefore, any disparities arising from the adoption of different employment definitions in previous surveys should not impede the harmonization process for the current survey under consideration.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to finer distinctions of employment (where finer means less common or affecting fewer individuals), like whether people on parental leave for more than 3 months can still be counted as employed, users should follow the skip pattern of the questionnaire, unless there are strong arguments against it. The guiding principle should be the logic of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ilo.org/resource/other/ilo-model-lfs-questionnaire-papi-job-type-start-2024-edition">ILO Model LFS Questionnaire</a>.</p>
<p><strong>potential_lf</strong></p>
<p>The ILO defines unemployment (as stated above) as seeking <em>and</em> available for a job. The potential labour force is formed by the “available potential job seekers”, who are available but not looking for a job and the “unavailable job seekers”, that is those looking but not available. The below image (Figure 17 – <a class="reference external" href="https://ilostat.ilo.org/persons-outside-the-labour-force-how-inactive-are-they-really/">source here</a>) shows the different definitions.</p>
<p><br></br>
Figure 17 - Definition of different labor force status
<img alt="Definition of different labor force status" src="../../../_images/vars_potential_lf.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>The variable potential_lf thus codifies whether the person is not in the labour force over the past 7 days (lstatus=3, missing otherwise) but could potentially be they are i) available but not searching or ii) searching but not immediately available to work. The codes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 = No (not potentially in the labour force)</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Yes</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>underemployment</strong></p>
<p>Codifies whether the person is in the labour force and working over the past 7 days (lstatus=1, missing otherwise) but would take on more jobs or more hours at their job if possible/available. The codes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 = No (not underemployed)</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Yes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <a class="reference external" href="https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/description-labour-force-statistics/">ILO guidelines (see chapter 9)</a> defines “time-related” underemployment additionally as a person who has <em>worked less than a threshold relating to working time</em>, where the threshold is determined nationally. This is not done here. Users may add that using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">whours</span></code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>nlfreason</strong></p>
<p>nlfreason is the reason an individual was not in the labor force in the last 7 days. This variable is constructed for all those who are not presently employed and are not looking for work (lstatus=3) and missing otherwise.</p>
<p>Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Student (a person currently studying.)</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Housekeeper (a person who takes care of the house, older people, or children)</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Retired</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Disabled (a person who cannot work due to physical conditions)</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Other (a person does not work for any other reason)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fill this information for all people interviewed in the labor section of the questionnaire regardless of their age.</p>
<p><strong>unempldur_l</strong></p>
<p>unempldur_l is a continuous variable specifying the duration of unemployment in months (lower bracket).</p>
<p>The variable is constructed for all unemployed persons (lstatus=2, otherwise missing). If it is specified as continuous in the survey, it records the numbers of months in unemployment. If the variable is categorical it records the lower boundary of the bracket.</p>
<p>Missing values are allowed for everyone who is not unemployed. Other missing values are also allowed.</p>
<p><strong>unempldur_u</strong></p>
<p>unempldur_u is a continuous variable specifying the duration of unemployment in months (upper bracket).</p>
<p>The variable is constructed for all unemployed persons (lstatus=2, otherwise missing). If it is specified as continuous in the survey, it records the numbers of months in unemployment. If the variable is categorical it records the upper boundary of the bracket. If the right bracket is open a missing value should be inputted.</p>
<p>Missing values are allowed for everyone who is not unemployed. Other missing values are also allowed. If the duration of unemployment is not reported as a range, but as continuous variables, the unempldur_l and unempldur_u variables will have the same value. If the high range is open-ended the unempldur_u variable will be missing.</p>

<h3>Primary Employment, 7-day reference period<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-employment-7-day-reference-period" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>empstat</strong></p>
<p>empstat is a categorical variable that specifies the main employment status in the last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all individuals. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The definitions are taken from the International Labor Organization’s Classification of Status in Employment with some revisions to take into account the data available.</p>
<p>Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Paid Employee</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Employer</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Self-employed (or own-account)</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Paid Employee</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The ‘continuous’ criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-paid employee includes contributing family workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. All apprentices should be mapped as ‘non-paid employee’</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = Employer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as self-employed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4 = Self-employed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Own account or self-employment includes jobs where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and where one has not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period.</p>
<p>Members of producers’ cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services, in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other, workers not classifiable by status include those for whom insufficient relevant information is available and/or who cannot be included in any of the above categories.</p>
<p><strong>ocusec</strong></p>
<p>ocusec is a categorical variable that specifies the sector of activity in the last 7 days. It classifies the main job’s sector of activity of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p>Four categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Public sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces)</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Private, NGO</p></li>
<li><p>3 = State-owned</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Public Sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces) Public sector</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The part of economy run by the government.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 = Private, NGO</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Private sector is that part of the economy which is both run for private profit and is not controlled by the state, it also includes non-governmental organizations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = State-owned enterprises</p></li>
</ul>
<p>State-owned includes para-state firms and all others in which the government has control (participation over 50%).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Select this option is the questionnaire does not ask for State-owned enterprises, and only for Public sector.</p>
<p>Additionally, recall the fact that, in common English usage, a public company (often denoted as public limited company or PLC) are private companies in the private sector but whose ownership is organized via stocks tradeable in a public market, i.e., accessible to all, not run by the public sector. Figure 18 below is an example of the relevant question in the 2010 Pakistani LFS:</p>
<p><br></br>
Figure 18 - Excerpt of PAK LFS questionnaire
<img alt="Excerpt of PAK LFS questionnaire" src="../../../_images/vars_ocusec.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>Here code 4 represents a public enterprise (explicitly mentioned as a corporation created by a legislative body) and code 6 a public limited company (a private sector company whose shares can be bought by the general public). Code 6 should not be considered part of the public sector.</p>
<p>Coding would then be (assuming the original question is called var_sector):</p>

<p>Note to not code basis of occupation (ISCO) or industry (ISIC) codes.</p>
<p>Finally, in case that the information is only asked to wage employees (i.e., own account workers are excluded), assume that workers other than wage employees work in the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>industry_orig</strong></p>
<p>industry_orig is a string variable that specifies the original industry codes in the last 7 days for the main job provided in the survey (the actual question) and should correspond to whatever is in the original file with no recoding. It will contain missing values for people below the working age. Other missing values are allowed. It classifies the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise</p>
<p><strong>industrycat_isic</strong></p>
<p>Code (string variable) of the industry according to the International Standard Industry Classification (ISIC) in the last 7 days for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. Note that the preamble to the harmonization code should record what version of ISIC is being used.</p>
<p>The code should always be as long as the longest depth available for the ISIC version. For example, the latest version at the time of writing (ISIC Rev 4, <a class="reference external" href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/census/documents/isic_rev4.pdf">available here</a>) codes industries by sections, divisions, groups, and classes, in decreasing order of hierarchy.</p>
<p>Figure 19 shows the classification structure for the manufacture of machinery and equipment. The letter C codes the Manufacturing section, while the code 28 represents “Manufacture of machines and equipment n.e.c” division. This division has two groups (281 and 282), containing one and three classes respectively.</p>
<p><br></br>
Figure 19 - Example of ISIC classification
<img alt="Example of ISIC classification" src="../../../_images/vars_industrycat_isic_1.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>A single section will often cover several divisions. While D has only one division (35 – electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply) and could be potentially shortened to “3”, section C covers divisions 10 to 33.</p>
<p>If the information in the survey is only present at section level (or can only be translated from the national industry classification to section level) this variable should be a string with the letter coding the correct section.</p>
<p>In most cases, information will be coded as a set of digits. In this case, the codification should be a string of four digits with a zero padding before for division 1 through 9 (i.e., 01, to 09).</p>
<p>As an example, Figure 20, puts together a few excerpts from ISIC Rev.4. Note that, if we do not codify correctly, group 14 (Animal production) may be misunderstood for division 14 (Manufacture of wearing apparel).</p>
<p>If we only have information up to the group label, fill out the reminder of the digits with zeros. Hence the purple box in Figure 20 would be coded as “0140”. The red box, as we have all digits, including the zero padding at the start codes as “0142”.</p>
<p>The act of adding zeroes to the end is standard if the lower level hierarchy has no further distinctions and can be seen in the yellow box, where group 142 has no classes (or just one class) and thus is coded as “1420”.</p>
<p>Some groups do in fact have several classes, as can be seen for group 151. Again, if we only had information up to group level, we ought to code “1510”. If we have more detailed information, for example identifying the industry as “Tanning and dressing of leather; dressing and dyeing of fur” (green box in Figure 20 below) we would code “1511”.</p>
<p><br></br>

<br></br></p>
<p><strong>industrycat10</strong></p>
<p>industrycat10 is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit industry classification in the last 7 days for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. The codes for the main job are given here based on the UN International Standard Industrial Classification. It classifies the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise</p>
<p>Ten categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Agriculture, Hunting, Fishing, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Mining</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Manufacturing</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Public Utility Services</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Construction</p></li>
<li><p>6 = Commerce</p></li>
<li><p>7 = Transport and Communications</p></li>
<li><p>8 = Financial and Business Services</p></li>
<li><p>9 = Public Administration</p></li>
<li><p>10 = Other Services, Unspecified</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the case of different classifications (former Soviet Union republics, for example), recoding has been done to best match the ISIC codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Category 10 is also assigned for unspecified categories or items.</p></li>
<li><p>If all 10 categories cannot be identified in the questionnaire create this variable as missing and proceed to create industrycat4.</p></li>
<li><p>Over the years, the different ISIC versions have changed. The original industrycat10 categories are largely based on ISIC Revision 2. The below Figure 21 shows how to classify the different ISIC revision codes into industrycat10.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></br>
Figure 21 - Overview of coding of industrycat based on different ISIC revisions
<img alt="Overview of coding of industrycat based on different ISIC revisions" src="../../../_images/vars_industrycat10.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p><strong>industrycat4</strong></p>
<p>industrycat4 is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit industry classification in the last 7 days for the main job for Broad Economic Activities. This variable is either created directly from the data (if industry classification does not exist for ten categories) or created from industrycat10.</p>
<p>Four categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Agriculture</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Industry</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Services</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Other</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This variable is either created directly from the data (if industry classification does not exist for ten categories) or created from industrycat10.</p>
<p><strong>occup_orig</strong></p>
<p>occup_orig is a string variable that specifies the original occupation code in the last 7 days for the main job. This variable corresponds to whatever is in the original file with no recoding.</p>
<p><strong>occup_isco</strong></p>
<p>Code (string variable) of the occupation according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) in the last 7 days for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. Note that the preamble to the harmonization code should record what version of ISCO is being used.</p>
<p>The code should always be as long as the longest depth available for the ISCO) version. For example, the latest version at the time of writing (ISCO-08, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm">available here</a>) codes occupations by Major, Sub-major, Minor, and Unit groups, in decreasing order of hierarchy.</p>
<p>ISCO code Major groups cover a single digit, running from 1 (Managers) to 9 (Elementary Occupations) with the additional category 0 (Armed Forces Occupations). Hence there is only need for zero-padding on the left side for Armed Forces Occupations. Figure 22 shows an example of the possible values that can be taken on.</p>
<p><br></br>
Figure 22 - Example of values for ISCO-08
<img alt="Example of values for ISCO-08" src="../../../_images/vars_occup_isco.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>If we only had information at Major Group level, a person working as a Services and Sales Worker ought to be coded as the number 5000. If the information is at Sub-major Group level, it should be codified as the number 5100 for a Personal Services Worker, while a Travel Attendant, a Conductor, or a Guide (if information at Minor Group level) should be coded as the number 5110.</p>
<p>Information at the Unit Group level can be coded as is, since it already is at the maximum possible depth.</p>
<p><strong>occup_skill</strong></p>
<p>Categorical code for the broad skill level of workers at the main job in the last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. It follows from the ISCO classification as shown in Figure 23.</p>
<p><br></br>
Figure 23 - ISCO broad skill level classification
<img alt="ISCO broad skill level classification" src="../../../_images/vars_occup_skill.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>Thus, the codes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = High</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Medium</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Low
. = Armed Forces and not elsewhere classified</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>occup</strong></p>
<p>occup is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit occupational classification for the main job in the last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. This variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country. Most surveys collect detailed information and then code it, without keeping the original data, no attempt has been made to correct or check the original coding. The classification is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). It classifies the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>Eleven categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Managers</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Professionals</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Technicians and associate professionals</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Clerical support workers</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Service and sales workers</p></li>
<li><p>6 = Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers</p></li>
<li><p>7 = Craft and related trades workers</p></li>
<li><p>8 = Plant and machine operators, and assemblers</p></li>
<li><p>9 = Elementary occupations</p></li>
<li><p>10 = Armed forces occupations</p></li>
<li><p>99 = Other/unspecified</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wage_no_compen</strong></p>
<p>wage_no_compen is a continuous variable that specifies the last wage payment in local currency of any employed individual (lstatus=1) in its primary occupation at the reference period reported in the survey and it is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the main job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated most time in the week preceding the survey. This excludes tips, bonuses, other compensation such as dwellings or clothes, and other payments. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For all those with self-employment or owners of own businesses, this should be net revenues (net of all costs EXCEPT for tax payments) or the amount of salary taken from the business. Due to the almost complete lack of information on taxes, the wage from main job is NOT net of taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>By definition, non-paid employees (empstat=2) should have wage=0.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference period of the wage_no_compen will be recorded in the unitwage variable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>unitwage</strong></p>
<p>unitwage is a categorical variable that specifies the time reference for the wage_no_compen variable. It specifies the time unit measurement for the wages of any individual (lstatus=1 &amp; empstat=1) and it is missing otherwise. Acceptable values include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Daily</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Weekly</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Every two weeks</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Twice monthly</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Monthly</p></li>
<li><p>6 = Quarterly</p></li>
<li><p>7 = Every six months</p></li>
<li><p>8 = Annually</p></li>
<li><p>9 = Hourly</p></li>
<li><p>10 = Other</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>whours</strong></p>
<p>whours is a continuous variable that specifies the hours of work last week for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The main job defined as that occupation that the person dedicated more time to over the past week. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the respondent was absent from the job in the week preceding the survey due to holidays, vacation, or sick leave, then record the time worked in the previous 7 days that the person worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the questions are phrased as, “on average, how many hours a week do you work?”.</p></li>
<li><p>For individuals who only give information on how many hours they work per day and no information on number of days worked a week, multiply the hours by 5 days.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of a question that has hours worked per month, divide by 4.3 to get weekly hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wmonths</strong></p>
<p>wmonths is a continuous variable that specifies the number of months worked in the last 12 months for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The main job is defined as that occupation that the person dedicated more time to over the past week. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p><strong>wage_total</strong></p>
<p>wage_total is a continuous variable that specifies the annualized wage payment (regular wage plus bonuses, in-kind, compensation, etc.) for the primary occupation in local currency of any individual (lstatus=1 &amp; empstat=1) and is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the main job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated most time in the week preceding the survey. This wage includes tips, compensations such as bonuses, dwellings or clothes, and other payments. wage_total should be equal to wage_no_compen in case there are no bonuses, tips etc. offered as part of the job. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. The annualization of the wage_total should consider the number of months/weeks the persons have been working and receiving this income. Harmonizer should not assume the person has been working the whole year. Box 4 shows the creation of wage_total when there are no bonuses nor other compensations.</p>

<p><strong>contract</strong></p>
<p>contract is a dummy variable that classifies the contract status (yes/no) of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. It indicates whether a person has a signed (formal and written – not verbal) contract, regardless of duration. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. Two categories after harmonization:</p>

<p><strong>empstat_2</strong></p>
<p>empstat_2 is a categorical variable that specifies employment status of the secondary job with reference period of last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all individuals. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The definitions are taken from the International Labor Organization’s Classification of Status in Employment with some revisions to take into account the data available. Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Paid Employee</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Employer</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Self-employed</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Paid Employee</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The ‘continuous’ criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-paid employee includes contributing family workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. All apprentices should be mapped as non-paid employee.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = Employer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and ‘contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as own account.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4 = Self-employed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Own account or self-employment includes jobs are those where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and have not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period.</p>
<p>Members of producers’ cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other, workers not classifiable by status include those for whom insufficient relevant information is available and/or who cannot be included in any of the above categories.</p>
<p><strong>ocusec_2</strong></p>
<p>ocusec_2 is a categorical variable that specifies the sector of activity in the last 7 days. It classifies the secondary job’s sector of activity of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p>Four categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Public sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces)</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Private, NGO</p></li>
<li><p>3 = State-owned</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Public Sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Public sector is the part of economy run by the government.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 = Private, NGO</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Private sector is that part of the economy which is both run for private profit and is not controlled by the state, it also includes non-governmental organizations</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = State-owned enterprises</p></li>
</ul>
<p>State-owned includes para-state firms and all others in which the government has control (participation over 50%).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Select this option is the questionnaire does not ask for State-owned enterprises, and only for Public sector.</p>
<p>Notes: Do not code basis of occupation (ISCO) or industry (ISIC) codes.</p>
<p><strong>industry_orig_2</strong></p>
<p>industry_orig_2 is a string variable that specifies the original industry codes for the second job with reference period of the last 7 days and should correspond to whatever is in the original file with no recoding.

<p><strong>industrycat10_2</strong></p>
<p>industrycat10_2 is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit industry classification that classifies the second job with reference period of the last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. The codes for the second job are given here based on the UN International Standard Industrial Classification.</p>
<p>Ten categories after harmonization:</p>

<li><p>10 = Other Services, Unspecified</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the case of different classifications (former Soviet Union republics, for example), recoding has been done to best match the ISIC codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Category 10 is also assigned for unspecified categories or items.</p></li>
<li><p>For details on how to code different ISIC versions to industrycat10_2 see the industrycat10 entry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>industrycat4_2</strong></p>
<p>industrycat4_2 is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit industry classification for Broad Economic Activities for the second job with reference period of the last 7 days. This variable is either created directly from the data (if industry classification does not exist for 10 categories) or created from industrycat10_2.</p>
<p>Four categories after harmonization:</p>

<li><p>1 = Agriculture</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Industry</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Services</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Other</p></li>

<p><strong>occup_isco_2</strong></p>
<p>Code (string variable) of the occupation according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) in the last 7 days for the second job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>See occup_isco for the details.</p>
<p><strong>occup_skill_2</strong></p>
<p>Categorical code for the broad skill level of workers at the second job in the last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>See occup_skill for details.</p>
<p><strong>occup_2</strong></p>
<p>occup_2 is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit occupation classification. It classifies the second job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. This variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. Most surveys collect detailed information and then code it, without keeping the original data. No attempt has been made to correct or check the original coding. The classification is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). In the case of different classifications, re-coding has been done to best match the ISCO.</p>
<p>Eleven categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Managers</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Professionals</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Technicians and associate professionals</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Clerical support workers</p></li>

<li><p>99 = Other/unspecified</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wage_no_compen_2</strong></p>
<p>wage_no_compen_2 is a continuous variable that specifies the last wage payment in local currency of any individual (lstatus=1 &amp; empstat=1) in its secondary occupation and is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the second job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated the second most amount of time in the week preceding the survey. This excludes tips, bonuses, other compensation such as dwellings or clothes, and other payments. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For all those with self-employment or owners of own businesses, this should be net revenues (net of all costs EXCEPT for tax payments) or the amount of salary taken from the business. Due to the almost complete lack of information on taxes, the wage from main job is NOT net of taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>By definition, non-paid employees (empstat_2=2) should have wage=0.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference period of the wage_no_compen_2 will be recorded in the unitwage_2 variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use gross wages when available and net wages only when gross wages are not available. This is done to make it easy to compare earnings in formal and informal sectors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>unitwage_2</strong></p>
<p>unitwage_2 is a categorical variable that specifies the time reference for the wage_no_compen_2 variable. It specifies the time unit measurement for the wages for the secondary job of any individual (lstatus=1 &amp; empstat=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>Ten categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Daily</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Weekly</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Every two weeks</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Twice monthly</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Monthly</p></li>
<li><p>6 = Quarterly</p></li>
<li><p>7 = Every six months</p></li>
<li><p>8 = Annually</p></li>
<li><p>9 = Hourly</p></li>
<li><p>10 = Other</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>whours_2</strong></p>
<p>whours_2 is a continuous variable that specifies the hours of work in last week for the second job with reference period of the last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>The second job defined as that occupation that the person dedicated the second most amount of time to over the past week. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. The lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the respondent was absent from the job in the week preceeding the survey due to holidays, vacation, or sick leave, then record the time worked in the previous 7 days that the person worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the questions are phrased as, “on average, how many hours a week do you work?”.</p></li>
<li><p>For individuals who only give information on how many hours they work per day and no information on number of days worked a week, multiply the hours by 5 days.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of a question that has hours worked per month, divide by 4.3 to get weekly hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wmonths_2</strong></p>
<p>wmonths_2 is a continuous variable that specifies the number of months worked in the last 12 months for the secondary job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The secondary job is defined as that occupation in which the person dedicated less time than the primary job over the past week. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p><strong>wage_total_2</strong></p>
<p>wage_total_2 is a continuous variable that specifies the annualized wage payment (regular wage plus bonuses, in-kind, compensation, etc.) in local currency of any individual (lstatus=1 &amp; empstat=1) in its secondary occupation and is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the secondary job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated the second most amount of time in the week preceding the survey. This wage includes tips, compensations such as bonuses, dwellings or clothes, and other payments. wage_total_2 should be equal to wage_no_compen_2 in case there are no bonuses, tips etc. offered as part of the job. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The annualization of the wage_total_2 should consider the number of months/weeks the persons have been working and receiving this income. Harmonizer should not assume the person has been working the whole year.</p></li>
<li><p>For an example on how to annualize wage see 5.2.2 Primary Employment last 7-days variable wage_total (Example: Creation of wage_total when there are no bonuses nor other compensations).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>firmsize_l_2</strong></p>
<p>firmsize_l_2 specifies the lower bracket of the firm size. The variable is constructed for all persons who are employed. If it is continuous, it records the number of people working for the same employer. If the variable is categorical, it records the lower boundary of the bracket.</p>
<p><strong>firmsize_u_2</strong></p>
<p>firmsize_u_2 specifies the upper bracket of the firm size. The variable is constructed for all persons who are employed. If it is continuous, it records the number of people working for the same employer. If the variable is categorical, it records the upper boundary of the bracket. If the right bracket is open, a missing value should be inputted.</p>

<p>t_hours_total is a continuous variable that specifies the hours of work in last 12 months in all jobs including primary, secondary and others.</p>
<p>If the number of months worked is missing, the harmonizer may assume that the person worked the whole year inputting the “average, commonly hours worked” (i.e., using usually worked hours instead of actual). Moreover, the harmonizer may assume that the person worked the whole year in this job (multiply monthly data by 12, weekly data by 48). Thus, the variable functions as an upper bound.</p>

The formal definition of unemployed usually includes being ‘able to accept a job.’ This last question was asked in a minority of surveys and is, thus, not incorporated in the present definition. A person presently not working but waiting for the start of a new job is considered unemployed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = Not-in-labor force</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A person is defined as not-in-labor force if he or she is, presently not working and it is not actively seeking a job during the last 12 months or reference week.</p>
<p>For further details, please see the definition of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lstatus</span></code> (7 day recall).</p>
<p><strong>potential_lf_year</strong></p>
<p>Codifies whether the person is not in the labour force over the past year (lstatus_year=3, missing otherwise) but could potentially be they are i) available but not searching or ii) searching but not immediately available to work. The codes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 = No (not potentially in the labour force)</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Yes</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>underemployment_year</strong></p>
<p>Codifies whether the person was in the labour force and working in the past 12 months (lstatus_year=1, missing otherwise) but would take on more jobs or more hours at their job if possible/available. The codes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 = No (not underemployed)</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Yes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See details under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">underemployment</span></code> (7 day recall) for more details.</p>
<p><strong>nlfreason_year</strong></p>
<p>nlfreason_year is the reason an individual was not in the labor force in the last 12 months. This variable is constructed for all those who are not presently employed and are not looking for work (lstatus_year=3) and missing otherwise.</p>
<p>Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Student (a person currently studying.)</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Housewife (a person who takes care of the house, older people, or children)</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Retired</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Disabled (a person who cannot work due to physical conditions)</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Other (a person does not work for any other reason)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not put missing values for people below the working age, employed, and unemployed. Other missing values allowed.</p>
<p><strong>unempldur_l_year</strong></p>
<p>unempldur_l_year is a continuous variable specifying the duration of unemployment in months (lower bracket).</p>
<p>The variable is constructed for all unemployed persons (lstatus_year=2, otherwise missing). If it is specified as continuous in the survey, it records the numbers of months in unemployment. If the ariable is categorical it records the lower boundary of the bracket.</p>
<p>Missing values are allowed for everyone who is not unemployed. Other missing values are also allowed.</p>
<p><strong>unempldur_u_year</strong></p>
<p>unempldur_u_year is a continuous variable specifying the duration of unemployment in months (upper bracket).</p>
<p>The variable is constructed for all unemployed persons (lstatus_year=2, otherwise missing). If it is specified as continuous in the survey, it records the numbers of months in unemployment. If the variable is categorical it records the upper boundary of the bracket. If the right bracket is open a missing value should be inputted.</p>
<p>Missing values are allowed for everyone who is not unemployed. Other missing values are also allowed. If the duration of unemployment is not reported as a range, but as continuous variables, the unempldur_l_year and unempldur_u_year variables will have the same value. If the high range is open- ended the unempldur_u_year variable will be missing.</p>

<p><strong>empstat_year</strong></p>
<p>empstat is a categorical variable that specifies the main employment status in the last 12 months of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all individuals. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The definitions are taken from the International Labor Organization’s Classification of Status in Employment with some revisions to take into account the data available. Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Paid Employee</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Employer</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Self-employed</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Paid Employee</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The ‘continuous’ criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-paid employee includes contributing family workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. All apprentices should be mapped as ‘non-paid employee’.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = Employer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as self-employed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4 = Self-employed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Own account or self-employment includes jobs where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and where one has not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period.</p>
<p>Members of producers’ cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services, in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other, workers not classifiable by status include those for whom insufficient relevant information is available and/or who cannot be included in any of the above categories.</p>
<p><strong>ocusec_year</strong></p>
<p>ocusec_year is a categorical variable that specifies the sector of activity in the last 12 months. It classifies the main job’s sector of activity of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p>Four categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Public sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces)</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Private, NGO</p></li>
<li><p>3 = State-owned</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Public Sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Public sector is the part of economy run by the government.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 = Private, NGO</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Private sector is that part of the economy which is both run for private profit and is not controlled by the state, it also includes non-governmental organizations</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 = State-owned enterprises</p></li>
</ul>
<p>State-owned includes para-state firms and all others in which the government has control (participation over 50%).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Select this option is the questionnaire does not ask for State-owned enterprises, and only for Public sector.</p>
<p>Notes: Do not code basis of occupation (ISCO) or industry (ISIC) codes.</p>
<p><strong>industry_orig_year</strong></p>
<p>industry_orig_year is a string variable that specifies the original industry codes in the last 12 months for the main job provided in the survey (the actual question) and should correspond to whatever is in the original file with no recoding.

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the case of different classifications (former Soviet Union republics, for example), recoding has been done to best match the ISIC codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Category 10 is also assigned for unspecified categories or items.</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>industrycat4_year</strong></p>
<p>industrycat4_year is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit industry classification in the last 12 months for the main job for Broad Economic Activities.

<p><strong>occup_orig_year</strong></p>
<p>occup_orig_year is a string variable that specifies the original occupation code in the last 12 months for the main job. This variable corresponds to whatever is in the original file with no recoding.</p>
<p><strong>occup_isco_year</strong></p>
<p>Code (string variable) of the occupation according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) in the last 12 months days for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus_year=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>See occup_isco for the details.</p>
<p><strong>occup_skill_year</strong></p>
<p>Categorical code for the broad skill level of workers at the main job in the last 12 months of any individual with a job (lstatus_year=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>See occup_skill for details.</p>
<p><strong>occup_year</strong></p>
<p>occup_year is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit occupational classification for the main job in the last 12 months of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. This variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country. Most surveys collect detailed information and then code it, without keeping the original data, no attempt has been made to correct or check the original coding. The classification is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). It classifies the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus_year=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>Eleven categories after harmonization:</p>

<p><strong>wage_no_compen_year</strong></p>
<p>wage_no_compen_year is a continuous variable that specifies the last wage payment in local currency of any individual (lstatus_year =1 &amp; empstat_year =1) in its primary occupation at the reference period reported in the survey and it is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the main job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated most time in the 12 months preceding the survey. This excludes tips, bonuses, other compensation such as dwellings or clothes, and other payments. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For all those with self-employment or owners of own businesses, this should be net revenues (net of all costs EXCEPT for tax payments) or the amount of salary taken from the business. Due to the almost complete lack of information on taxes, the wage from main job is NOT net of taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>By definition, non-paid employees (empstat_year=2) should have wage=0.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference period of the wage_no_compen_year will be recorded in the unitwage_year variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use gross wages when available and net wages only when gross wages are not available. This is done to make it easy to compare earnings in formal and informal sectors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>unitwage_year</strong></p>
<p>unitwage_year is a categorical variable that specifies the time reference for the wage_no_compen_year variable. It specifies the time unit measurement for the wages of any individual (lstatus_year =1 &amp; empstat_year =1) and it is missing otherwise. Acceptable values include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Daily</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Weekly</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>whours_year</strong></p>
<p>whours_year is a continuous variable that specifies the hours of work last week for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The main job defined as that occupation that the person dedicated more time to over the past 12 months. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sometimes the questions are phrased as, “on average, how many hours a week do you work?”.</p></li>
<li><p>For individuals who only give information on how many hours they work per day and no information on number of days worked a week, multiply the hours by 5 days.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of a question that has hours worked per month, divide by 4.3 to get weekly hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wmonths_year</strong></p>
<p>wmonths_year is a continuous variable that specifies the number of months worked in the last 12 months for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The main job is defined as that occupation that the person dedicated more time to over the past 12 months. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p><strong>wage_total_year</strong></p>
<p>wage_total_year is a continuous variable that specifies the annualized wage payment (regular wage plus bonuses, in-kind, compensation, etc.) for the primary occupation in local currency of any individual (lstatus_year =1 &amp; empstat_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the main job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated most time in the year preceding the survey. This wage includes tips, compensations such as bonuses, dwellings or clothes, and other payments. wage_total_year should be equal to wage_no_compen_year in case there are no bonuses, tips etc. offered as part of the job. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. The annualization of the wage_total_year should consider the number of months/weeks the persons have been working and receiving this income. Harmonizer should not assume the person has been working the whole year.</p>
<p>For an example on how to annualize wage see 5.2.2 Primary Employment last 7-days variable wage_total (Example: Creation of wage_total when there are no bonuses nor other compensations).</p>
<p><strong>contract_year</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>socialsec_year</strong></p>
<p>socialsec_year is a dummy variable that classifies the social security status (yes/no) of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. Variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country. However, this variable is only constructed if there is an explicit question about pension plans or social security. Two categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 = No</p></li>
<li><p>1 = Yes</p></li>

</ul>
<p>This variable is either created directly from the data (if industry classification does not exist for 10 categories) or created from industrycat10_2_year.</p>
<p><strong>occup_orig_2_year</strong></p>
<p>occup_orig_2_year is a string variable that specifies the original occupation code in the last 12 months for the secondary job. This variable corresponds to whatever is in the original file with no recoding.</p>
<p><strong>occup_isco_2_year</strong></p>
<p>Code (string variable) of the occupation according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) for the second job of any individual with a job in the last 12 months (lstatus_year=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>See occup_isco for the details.</p>
<p><strong>occup_skill_2_year</strong></p>
<p>Categorical code for the broad skill level of workers at the second job in the last 12 months of any individual with a job (lstatus_year=1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>See occup_skill for details.</p>
<p><strong>occup_2_year</strong></p>
<p>occup_2_year is a categorical variable that specifies the 1-digit occupation classification. It classifies the second job of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. This variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. Most surveys collect detailed information and then code it, without keeping the original data. No attempt has been made to correct or check the original coding. The classification is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). In the case of different classifications, re-coding has been done to best match the ISCO.</p>
<p>Eleven categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Managers</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Professionals</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Technicians and associate professionals</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Clerical support workers</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Service and sales workers</p></li>
<li><p>6 = Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers</p></li>
<li><p>7 = Craft and related trades workers</p></li>
<li><p>8 = Plant and machine operators, and assemblers</p></li>
<li><p>9 = Elementary occupations</p></li>
<li><p>10 = Armed forces occupations</p></li>
<li><p>99 = Other/unspecified</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wage_no_compen_2_year</strong></p>
<p>wage_no_compen_2_year is a continuous variable that specifies the last wage payment in local currency of any individual (lstatus_year =1 &amp; empstat_year =1) in its secondary occupation and is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the second job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated the second most amount of time in the week preceding the survey. This excludes tips, bonuses, other compensation such as dwellings or clothes, and other payments. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For all those with self-employment or owners of own businesses, this should be net revenues (net of all costs EXCEPT for tax payments) or the amount of salary taken from the business. Due to the almost complete lack of information on taxes, the wage from main job is NOT net of taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>By definition, non-paid employees (empstat_year_2 =2) should have wage=0.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference period of the wage_no_compen_year_2 will be recorded in the unitwage_2_year variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use gross wages when available and net wages only when gross wages are not available. This is done to make it easy to compare earnings in formal and informal sectors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>unitwage_2_year</strong></p>
<p>unitwage_2_year is a categorical variable that specifies the time reference for the wage_no_compen_2_year variable. It specifies the time unit measurement for the wages for the secondary job of any individual (lstatus_year =1 &amp; empstat_year =1) and is missing otherwise.</p>
<p>Ten categories after harmonization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 = Daily</p></li>
<li><p>2 = Weekly</p></li>
<li><p>3 = Every two weeks</p></li>
<li><p>4 = Twice monthly</p></li>
<li><p>5 = Monthly</p></li>
<li><p>6 = Quarterly</p></li>
<li><p>7 = Every six months</p></li>
<li><p>8 = Annually</p></li>
<li><p>9 = Hourly</p></li>
<li><p>10 = Other</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>whours_2_year</strong></p>
<p>whours_2_year is a continuous variable that specifies the hours of work in last week for the second job with reference period of the last 12 months of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The second job defined as that occupation that the person dedicated the second most amount of time to over the past year. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. The lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sometimes the questions are phrased as, “on average, how many hours a week do you work?”.</p></li>
<li><p>For individuals who only give information on how many hours they work per day and no information on number of days worked a week, multiply the hours by 5 days.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of a question that has hours worked per month, divide by 4.3 to get weekly hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>wmonths_2_year</strong></p>
<p>wmonths_2_year is a continuous variable that specifies the number of months worked in the last 12 months for the secondary job of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The secondary job is defined as that occupation in which the person dedicated less time than the primary job over the past year. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p><strong>wage_total_2_year</strong></p>
<p>wage_total_2_year is a continuous variable that specifies the annualized wage payment (regular wage plus bonuses, in-kind, compensation, etc.) in local currency of any individual (lstatus_year =1 &amp; empstat_year =1) in its secondary occupation and is missing otherwise. The wage should come from the secondary job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated the second most amount of time in the year preceding the survey. This wage includes tips, compensations such as bonuses, dwellings or clothes, and other payments. wage_total_2_year should be equal to wage_no_compen_2_year in case there are no bonuses, tips etc. offered as part of the job. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The annualization of the wage_total_2_year should consider the number of months/weeks the persons have been working and receiving this income. Harmonizer should not assume the person has been working the whole year.</p></li>
<li><p>For an example on how to annualize wage see 5.2.2 Primary Employment last 7-days variable wage_total (Example: Creation of wage_total when there are no bonuses nor other compensations).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>firmsize_l_2_year</strong></p>
<p>firmsize_l_2_year specifies the lower bracket of the firm size. The variable is constructed for all persons who are employed. If it is continuous, it records the number of people working for the same employer. If the variable is categorical, it records the lower boundary of the bracket.</p>
<p><strong>firmsize_u_2_year</strong></p>
<p>firmsize_u_2_year specifies the upper bracket of the firm size. The variable is constructed for all persons who are employed. If it is continuous, it records the number of people working for the same employer. If the variable is categorical, it records the upper boundary of the bracket. If the right bracket is open, a missing value should be inputted.</p>

<p>For any variable not collected in a country, the variable should be created and left as missing (.) in the final harmonized file.</p>
<p>Variables in the data files must follow the sequence in which they appear in the manual.
Labor status during last 12 months only reflects if the person has worked during last year or not, as the vast majority of the surveys do not provide enough information to distinguish those individuals that are unemployed from those that are out of the labor force.</p>
