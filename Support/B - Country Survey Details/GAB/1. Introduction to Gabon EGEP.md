## What is the Gabon EGEP?

The **Enquête Gabonaise pour l’Évaluation de la Pauvreté (EGEP‑2)** is a **national household poverty survey** carried out by Gabon’s national statistics office, La Direction Générale de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (DGSEE) in **2017**. It interviewed 7,992 households and is nationally representative.  

EGEP is **not** a labor force survey; its primary objective is to *measure living standards and poverty*. It includes a labor module with a questionnaire consistent with an LFS. The labor content is usable, but the survey is **not designed** as a stand‑alone LFS.

A prior round of the EGEP (EGEP-1) was conducted in 2005. While that exists, the 2017 profile indicates that 2017 results are not comparable to 2005 due to major questionnaire differences; we therefore do not use 2005.

## What does the EGEP labor module cover?

The EGEP labor module contains information on demographic characteristics, education, migration, and labor market activities over the past 7 days and 12 months. 

The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:

| Year | HH count | Individual count |
|---|---|---|
| 2005 |          7,989  |                      28,268  |

## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are not accessible to the public and researchers have to request the data from the DGSEE. The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to gld@worldbank.org

## What is the sampling procedure?

The EGEP employs a two-stage stratified sampling design to gather representative data on the country's labor force. This sampling methodology involves selecting Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) in the first stage and households within each PSU in the second stage. Both stages employ random selection techniques, ensuring the sample's representativeness. 

There are 11 strata, including Libreville; Port‑Gentil; Franceville; Nord‑Urbain; Nord‑Rural; Sud‑Urbain; Sud‑Rural; Est‑Urbain; Est‑Rural; Ouest‑Urbain; and Ouest‑Rural.


## What is the significance level
Official results are published at national, urban/rural, and strata levels 

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Unemployment

The unemployment rate (~11%) in the 2017 EGEP is much lower than that reported by ILO at around ~20%.
