## What is the ENEC?
ENEC is Gabon’s official labor force survey carried out by Gabon’s national statistics office, La Direction Générale de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (DGSEE). It is designed to measure employment, unemployment, and related labor-market indicators using ILO-consistent concepts. 

**Comparison with EGEP.** ENEC and EGEP are different types of surveys: ENEC is a stand-alone labor force survey, while EGEP is a poverty survey with a labor module. Despite this difference, they share a substantial common core of labor questions: employment status, main and secondary jobs, hours, occupation, industry, and earnings, which are sufficient for GLD harmonization. Where they diverge is mainly outside that core: EGEP adds extensive poverty and welfare questions, while ENEC goes deeper on the labor side with more detail on unemployment, contracts, benefits, and working conditions.

## What does ENEC cover?
ENEC has two parts: a household questionnaire and an individual employment questionnaire. The household part collects basic information on people, housing, and assets. The individual part focuses on work: it identifies who is working or not, collects details on main and secondary jobs, and asks about job search, unemployment, income, and working conditions. It also includes some questions on non-labor income and aspects of decent work.

| Year | HH count | Individual count |
|------|----------|------------------|
| 2024 | 3,438    | 14,913           |

## Where can the data be found?
The datasets are not accessible to the public and researchers have to request the data from the DGSEE. The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to gld@worldbank.org

## What is the sampling procedure?
ENEC 2024 uses a two-stage, stratified random sample drawn from the 2013 census frame. In the first stage, 176 enumeration areas (secteurs de dénombrement) are selected. In the second stage, a fresh household listing is conducted in each selected area and 20 households are drawn with equal probability. Stratification covers 13 domains composed of the nine provinces and the four largest cities (Libreville, Port-Gentil, Owendo, and Akanda) with urban and rural parts considered to ensure national representativeness. 

## What is the geographic significance level?
Official estimates are designed for the national level and for each of the 13 strata, the nine provinces plus the four largest cities (Libreville, Port-Gentil, Owendo, and Akanda). 

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Unemployment

The unemployment estimates for the ENEC in GLD count people who looked for work in the past 30 days and are available to start within the next two weeks, following the international definition. However, the national unemployment estimates are broader, as they also include discouraged workers and those who do not know how to look for a job. For users who wish to emulate this definition, we propose to create a variable `lstatus_alt` that identifies unemployment consistent with the national definition:

```
	gen byte lstatus_alt = lstatus

	* Re-classify discouraged workers 
	replace lstatus_alt = 2 if inlist(SE8a, 1,4) & SE8b == 1 & lstatus == 3

	* Not in the labor force
	replace lstatus_alt = 3 if missing(lstatus_alt) & age >= minlaborage 
	replace lstatus_alt = . if age < minlaborage
	label var lstatus_alt "Labor status"
	label values lstatus_alt lbllstatus
```


### Industry and Occupation
The ENEC is compatible at the two digits with ISCO 2008 and ISIC version 4.
