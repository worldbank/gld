  Introduction to Gabon Enquête Nationale sur l’Emploi et le Chômage (ENEC 2024)
</h2>

## What is ENEC?
ENEC 2024 is Gabon’s official labor force survey designed to measure employment, unemployment, and related labor-market indicators using International Labour Organization (ILO)–consistent concepts. 

**Comparison with EGEP 2017.** ENEC and EGEP are different types of surveys: ENEC is a stand-alone labor force survey, while EGEP is a poverty survey with a labor module. Despite this difference, they share a substantial common core of labor questions: employment status, main and secondary jobs, hours, occupation, industry, and earnings, which are sufficient for GLD harmonization. Where they diverge is mainly outside that core: EGEP adds extensive poverty and welfare questions, while ENEC goes deeper on the labor side with more detail on unemployment, contracts, benefits, and working conditions.

## What does ENEC cover?
ENEC has a household questionnaire and a detailed individual employment questionnaire. The household component collects sociodemographic characteristics, housing conditions, and asset ownership. The individual component determines current labor status for the seven-day reference week and then gathers detailed information on the respondent’s main job and any secondary job, including occupation and industry, status in employment, sector, firm size, formality markers (such as registrations and contracts), hours and months worked, pay modalities and income (point values or brackets), benefits and deductions, schedules, leave, accidents, and social protection. It also records job-search behavior, unemployment and its duration, transitions and preferences, non-labor income, and multiple “decent work” dimensions such as security, fairness, and work–life balance.

## Where can the data be found?
The datasets are not accessible to the public and researchers have to request the data from the DGSEE. The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to gld@worldbank.org

## What is the sampling procedure?
ENEC 2024 uses a two-stage, stratified random sample drawn from the 2013 census frame. In the first stage, 176 enumeration areas (secteurs de dénombrement) are selected. In the second stage, a fresh household listing is conducted in each selected area and 20 households are drawn with equal probability, yielding 3,520 households in total. Stratification covers 13 domains composed of the nine provinces and the four largest cities—Libreville, Port-Gentil, Owendo, and Akanda—with urban and rural parts considered to ensure representativeness across the national territory.

## What is the significance level?
Official estimates are designed for the **national** level and for each of the **13 strata**—the nine provinces plus the four largest cities (Libreville, Port-Gentil, Owendo, and Akanda). The stratification also considers **urban and rural** parts to ensure representativeness; estimates below these domains (e.g., smaller administrative units) are not guaranteed to be precise.
