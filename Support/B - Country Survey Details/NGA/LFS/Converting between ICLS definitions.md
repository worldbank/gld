# Introduction
Since the passing of the [resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization](https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm) in 2013 at the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) surveys are at risk of a series break due to the change in the concept of employment.

In short, the ICLS 19 resolution restricts employment to *work performed for others in exchange for pay or profit*, meaning that own consumption work (e.g., subsistence agriculture or building housing for oneself) are not counted as employment.

The GLD codes the harmonizationâ€™s `lstatus` variable based on the concept used in the survey. This has been the case for all years in the Nigeria LFS. Nonetheless, it possible to alter the code so that it matches the previous definition by simply delete two lines of code to define "N1" as shown below. 

# Current coding for the each survey of the Nigeria ILFS

Currently, the code used to create the `lstatus` variable (which distinguishes between employment, unemployment, and out of the labour force) is the following:

```
 *<_lstatus_>
	gen byte lstatus = .
	
	*E1: Worked for someone else for pay
	replace lstatus = 1 if atw1 == 1
	
	*E2: Ran or did any kind of business or farming
	replace lstatus = 1 if atw2 == 1
	
	*E3: Helped in a household business
	replace lstatus = 1 if atw3 == 1
	
	*E4: Absent from paid job or income generating activity
	replace lstatus = 1 if abs1a == 1
	
	*E5: Absent from unpaid job or income generating activity
	replace lstatus = 1 if abs1b == 1
	
	*U1: Looking for work/to do business in the past month, and available to work in the past week
	* Wanted to work: only asked for people who did not look for a job
	replace lstatus = 2 if (um1_1 == 1 | um1_2 == 1)  & (um10a == 1 | um10b == 1)

	*N1: NLF if worked but activity is mainly non-market (when <50 % of produce for own consumption)
	replace lstatus = 3 if lstatus == 1 & (atw2 == 1 | atw3 == 1) & (agf2a == 3 | (agf2a == 2 & inrange(agf2b, 1, 2)))
	
	*N2: All others
	replace lstatus = 3 if missing(lstatus) & age>=minlaborage
	
	
	replace lstatus = . if age < minlaborage
	label var lstatus "Labor status"
	la de lbllstatus 1 "Employed" 2 "Unemployed" 3 "Non-LF"
	label values lstatus lbllstatus
*</_lstatus_>

 
```

# Removed the lines of code to match the old definition

To obstain a unique series with the old definition, we would first need to identify the subsistence farmers, specifically those whose majority (>50%) of agricultral produce are meant for household consumption. These are easily
identified under "N1"; thus, deleting the lines of code under this category will automatically classify the subsistence farmers as employed.

```
 *<_lstatus_>
	gen byte lstatus = .
	
	*E1: Worked for someone else for pay
	replace lstatus = 1 if atw1 == 1
	
	*E2: Ran or did any kind of business or farming
	replace lstatus = 1 if atw2 == 1
	
	*E3: Helped in a household business
	replace lstatus = 1 if atw3 == 1
	
	*E4: Absent from paid job or income generating activity
	replace lstatus = 1 if abs1a == 1
	
	*E5: Absent from unpaid job or income generating activity
	replace lstatus = 1 if abs1b == 1
	
	*U1: Looking for work/to do business in the past month, and available to work in the past week
	* Wanted to work: only asked for people who did not look for a job
	replace lstatus = 2 if (um1_1 == 1 | um1_2 == 1)  & (um10a == 1 | um10b == 1)

	* Delete N1

	*N2: All others
	replace lstatus = 3 if missing(lstatus) & age>=minlaborage
	
	
	replace lstatus = . if age < minlaborage
	label var lstatus "Labor status"
	la de lbllstatus 1 "Employed" 2 "Unemployed" 3 "Non-LF"
	label values lstatus lbllstatus
*</_lstatus_>

 
```

# Size of subsistence farmers population in Nigeria

The size of the subsistence farmers is not as significant in other countries (e.g., Rwanda is over 30% of working age population), covering only ~4% of the working age population.  

| **Year** | **% of working age** |
|:---:|:---:|
| 2022 Q4 | 4.6% |
| 2023 Q1-Q3 |3.8% |
