## What is the NGA LFS?

The NGA LFS is a quarterly survey collected by the Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The quarterly survey was first launched in Q4 2022 as a successor to an annual household labor force survey, which was has been conducted
after the passage of the Statistics Act of 2008 (refer [here](utilities/On%20the%20Compilation%20of%20Labour%20Force%20Statistics%20for%20Nigeria.pdf)). The quarterly survey has adopted the ICLS-19 standards, improved household listing processes, organized continuous fieldwork, and utilized advanced technology for real-time data monitoring to enhance labor market statistics (for more information, refer to this [blog](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/moving-frontier-labor-market-statistics-nigeria))


## What does the NGA LFS cover?

The NGA LFS contains data on the labor force (employed and unemployed) and the household demographic and geographic characteristics, e.g., gender, age, education,and economic activity.

The raw datasets retrieved from the NBS do not contain full year data. In 2022, only data for Q4 is available, and in 2023, only Q1 - Q3. Before Q4 2022, the last labor force statistics were reported in Q4 2020 and the GLD does not have access to those datasets.

The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are:

| Year	| # of Households	| # of Individuals	|
| :-------	| :--------		| :--------	 	|
| 2022 (Q4 only)	| 8,777	| 46,618	|
| 2023 (Q1-Q3 only)	| 26,458	| 138,632	|


## Where can the data be found?

TThe LFS data for Nigeria can be found on the [Nigeria BLS Microdata Catalogue site](https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/nada/index.php/catalog). To obtain the data, users need to create and account and then request the data, by filling out the forms that will appear on the site. The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work for the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to [gld@worldbank.org](gld@worldbank.org).

## What is the sampling procedure?

The LFS follows a two-stage cluster sampling design. The first stage involes selection of the enumeration areas from each state, and the second stage involves selction of households. All households with members 15 years and above are eligible to be interviewed for the labor force component.


## What is the geographic significance level?

The data covers a sample of urban and rural enumeration areas in all 36 states of Nigeria. The survey is designed to detail estimates by urban/rural for the quarterly data, and state-level for the full-year data. Since the raw datasets do not cover the full year, we set the representativeness at urban/rural, and potentially update it once the full year data becomes available. 

Nigeria groups the 36 states into 6 regions. No changes have been made in the geographic divisions throughout the survey series.

## Other noteworthy aspects


### Definition of concept of employment

Since the passing of the [resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization](https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm) in 2013 at the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) surveys are at risk of a series break due to the change in the concept of employment.

In short, the ICLS 19 resolution restricts employment to *work performed for others in exchange for pay or profit*, meaning that own consumption work (e.g., subsistence agriculture or building housing for oneself) are not counted as employment.

The GLD codes the harmonizationâ€™s `lstatus` variable based on the concept used in the survey. This has been the case for all years in the Nigeria LFS. Nonetheless, it possible to alter the code so that it matches the previous definition. The precise details are covered in a [separate document here](Converting%20between%20ICLS%20definitions.md)


### ISCO and ISIC Classification

The data already included the occupation and economic activities in the ISCO-08 and ISIC version 4, respectively. 

### Missing data on wages

The GLD variable for wages , `wage_no_compen` and `wage_no_compen_2` are not coded in the Nigeria LFS even when wage information is available in the raw data. First, the wage variable in the raw data combines wages for both primary and secondary occupation. The GLD variables make a distinction between the wages for the primary occupation, `wage_no_compen` and `wage_no_compen_2`. Second, the variable in the raw data is a categorical variable representing a range of values, while the GLD requires the wage variables to be continuous. 

### Weight variable

The weight variable cannot be used to generate expanded population estimates as these are probability weights. Separate weights are provided for quarterly and annual. Because the datasets are not representative for the entire year, we recommend using quarterly weights
