# Industry classification
The Tunisia ENPE uses the Nomenclature des Activitées Tunisiennes (NAT) to classify industries. However, the industry codes 
in the raw datasets use two-digit classification that does not align with the NAT, except for the 2001 survey, which only had the 
3 digit NAT codes available. We use the correspondence table below recreated from other years when both 
3 digit NAT codes and two-digit aggregated classification are available.
