## What is the MEX ENOE?

The Mexican Labour Force and Unemployment Survey (ENOE) is the Mexican Labour Force Survey run as part of Mexico’s National Surveys series from 2005 to 2023. The survey ran as "new ENOE" (ENOE-N) from Q3 2020 to 2022 due to the CoVid-19 Pandemic (see details below).

## What does the MEX ENOE cover?

The Mexican ENOE is a labour force survey collecting information on demographic details (age, sex, location), education (academic), social security, labour market activities over the past quarter, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days. The years and sample size of ENOE(-N) harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	    | Survey type | # of Households | # of Individuals	| # of Observations |
| :-------	| :--------	  | :--------       | :--------         | :--------         |

Note that the ENOE is a panel survey where households are visited up to five times, explaining the low number of households for the sample size.

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata is free and publicly available on the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). INEGI created a [dedicated website](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enoe/15ymas/#Microdatos) that records ENOE. 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The ENOE uses a stratified two-stage design. The introductory section of ENOE provides ample detail on the breakdown and goals of the process. Below we share a sequence of images that will allow the user to access the information in the ENOE webpage. The text is in Spanish. Yet, we did a short summary in English at the bottom of this section to give the user a general idea of the information.

[Summarized Translation from the original version]

    The sampling is probabilistic, two-stage, stratified by conglomerates.

    Observation unit: The House.
    Sampling unit: The private home.
    Analysis unit: The home and the residents of the dwelling. [...]

    Sampling frame: The sampling frame used for the ENOE is INEGI's 2012 National Housing Framework, built from the cartographic and demographic information obtained during the 2010 Population and Housing Census, which is updated with each new census survey. [...]

## What is the geographic significance level?

The results are at national, state, and *cities of interest* levels as well as for certain size categories of localities. The cities of interest and sizes of cities, however, may vary over time. It is thus important to check the individual methodology reports. The information on the 2019 ENOE can be found under section 3.3 (page 39/40) of [that year's report](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825190613).

## Other Noteworthy Aspects

### Change in the name of Mexico's capitals

Variable `subnatid1` defines the first administrative unit, which are the states in Mexico's case. Mexico's capital, technically not a state (the precise discussion is omitted here), has throughout the dataset a distinct code, namely code 9.

However, in [2016 the name changed officially](https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5424565&fecha=05/02/2016) from "Distrito Federal" to "Ciudad de México". As such the `subnatid1` variable changed from "9 - Distrito Federal" (code up to and including 2015) to "9 - Ciudad de México" (from 2016 on). This is also covered by the variable `subnatid1_prev` in 2016.

### Evolution of the ENOE questionnaires

Over the years, the Mexican national statistics institute (INEGI) published a series of updates to the questionnaires. The changes are at times introduced from one quarter to the next within a year. The precise details can be seen on the [INEGI website](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enoe/15ymas/#documentacion) under the drop-down menu "Cuestionarios" (Questionnaires).

### Effect of the CoVid Pandemic

The CoVid 19 Pandemic interrupted regular surveys procedure. The data for 2020 was only collected as expected in the first quarter of 2020. 

From the third trimester of 2020 to the fourth trimester of 2022 INEGI operated a different survey (called ENOE_N) that contained a smaller sample size and a larger reliance on phone interviews. 

The data is available on the INEGI website but is not used in GLD. From the first trimester of 2023 the ENOE continued as before with some small methodological changes. The latest methodological note can be found [here](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/productos/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/nueva_estruc/889463909743.pdf).

### Classifications of industry and occupation used in ENOE and ENOE-N

In the Mexican National Survey of Occupation and Employment (Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo - ENOE) as well as then "New" ENOE (ENOE-N) following the years immediately after the pandemic (2020 Q3 to 2022 Q4) uses national classifications to code the industry and occupation of workers.

#### Overview of industry codes used in ENOE(-N)

The below table shows the classifications used at different points in time in the ENOE survey to code the industry workers are in. 

| From     | To      | Survey | Version Used | Notes                                         |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------------| --------------------------------------------- |
| Q1 2005  | Q2 2012 | ENOE   | SCIAN 04     |                                               |
| Q3 2005  | Q4 2022 | ENOE   | SCIAN 07     | ENOE de facto not run from Q2 2020 to Q4 2022 |
| Q3 2020  | Q2 2021 | ENOE-N | SCIAN 07     |                                               |
| Q3 2021  | Q4 2022 | ENOE-N | SCIAN 18     |                                               |
| Q1 2023  | Current | ENOE   | SCIAN 18     |                                               |

The classification document (see [example here](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/enoe/15ymas/doc/clasificaciones_enoe.pdf)) states that these versions are reduced versions of the actual SCIAN versions (i.e., with less detail) as respondents will not be able to describe their industries with total accuracy. These classifications contain about 180 unique codes. The precise details of the mapping can be found [here on separate document](Correspondence_NAICS_ISIC.md)


#### Overview of occupation codes used in ENOE(-N)

The below table shows the classifications used at different points in time in the ENOE survey to code the occupation workers hold.

| From     | To      | Survey | Version Used | Notes                                         |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------------| --------------------------------------------- |
| Q1 2005  | Q2 2012 | ENOE   | CMO (09?)    | Exact version of CMO unknown                  |
| Q3 2005  | Q4 2022 | ENOE   | SINCO 11     | ENOE de facto not run from Q2 2020 to Q4 2022 |
| Q3 2020  | Q2 2021 | ENOE-N | SINCO 11     |                                               |
| Q3 2021  | Q4 2022 | ENOE-N | SINCO 19     |                                               |
| Q1 2023  | Current | ENOE   | SINCO 19     |                                               |

The classification breakdown for the first surveys (2005 to Q2 2012) is listed as CMO-09. The GLD team expects that another systems must have been used prior (i.e., using CMO-2009 in 2005) but could not ascertain the details. We expect (hope) any CMO version prior to CMO-09 is not significantly different from it. The precise details of the mapping can be found [here on separate document](Correspondence_occup_ISCO.md)

### ENOE Panel

The ENOE survey revisits households over five consecutive quarters (with a longer period for individuals on phone surveys since CoVid-19). The GLD team has created code to generate a single file out of the individual harmonized files with unique panel identifiers. You may find the codes [here](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/tree/main/GLD/MEX/MEX_2005-2023_ENOE-Panel/MEX_2005-2023_ENOE-Panel_V01_M_V01_A_GLD/Programs).
