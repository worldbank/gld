# Conversion from ICLS-19 to ICLS-13 version

## Overview

At the 19th ICLS in 2013, a significant development emerged with the adoption of the [Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment, and labor underutilization](https://www.ilo.org/resource/resolution-concerning-statistics-work-employment-and-labour). This led to a change in the concept of employment compared to ICLS-13.

In essence, the ICLS-19 resolution delineates **employment** only as work conducted for pay or profit. Activities performed not in exchange for remuneration, like own-use production work, volunteer work, and unpaid trainee work, are classified as **other forms of work**.

The GLD harmonizes data following the standards used in each surveyâ€™s design and reporting. Data from LFS 2008 to 2020 use the ICLS-13 standard, and since 2021 we use ICLS-19. (see variable `icls_v` in each survey). To compare all LFS directly it is necessary to modify the coding of  variable `lstatus` using the nuances of the questionnaire.

## Framework for identifying employment in the LFS

All questionnaires used information on current activity to define employment through the ***Employment status*** section.

## From current coding to the ICLS-13 definition

In converting to the old definition, the approach adopted here is to create a variable that identifies those that are engaged in activities for market exchange as well as those that work without (or mostly without) market exchange. Figure 1 below shows an example of one of the relevant building blocks in the questionnaire for the employment definition.

In this case, if we code 2 and 3 for question 25, we can capture the employees according to the ICLS-13 definition. This strategy should be applied to all relevant questions in this section.

The code below applies this procedure to all relevant questions. It should be pasted *after* the code creating the ```lstatus``` variable as coded in the 2016 harmonization code file. 

```     
  * Create an indicator "emp_diff" that identifies the difference between definitions (emp_diff)
  gen emp_diff = 0 if inrange(lstatus, 2, 3)

  * Define the broader ICLS-13 concept
  gen icls_13 = 1 if inlist(prodaja,2,3)

  * Replace emp_diff is one if ICLS-19 is not employed but ICLS-13 yes
  replace emp_diff = 1 if emp_diff == 0 & icls_13 == 1
  
  * Use emp_diff to replace cases that differ
  replace lstatus = 1 if emp_diff == 1
```

We can go further an try to overwrite the employment status, occupation sector, industry and occupation of those that we assume would have - under the old definition - been recorded with their own consumption definition under the previous employment definition.

```     
   *Own consmuption farm/non-famr enterprises is considered as self-employed
	 replace empstat = 4 if  emp_diff == 1 & missing(empstat)
	 
	*Assume farmers work in the agricultural sector.
	replace industrycat10 = 1 if emp_diff == 1 & missing(industrycat10)
	
	*Assume farmers work in Skilled agricultural occupations.
	replace occup = 6 if emp_diff == 1 & missing(occup)
```
Finally, do the last bits of cleaning up to ensure the other labour variables are in line with what could be expected for own-consumption workers.

```
  * WAGE (send to missing)
  replace wage_no_compen = . if emp_diff == 1 
  
  * WHOURS (send to missing)
  replace whours = . if emp_diff == 1 
  
  * CONTRACT (send to missing)
  replace contract = . if emp_diff == 1 
  
  * SOCIAL SECURITY (send to missing)
  replace socialsec = . if emp_diff == 1
  
  * UNION (send to missing)
  replace union = . if emp_diff == 1 
  
  * NLF Reason (send to missing)
  replace nlfreason = . if emp_diff == 1 

```

The figure below presents labor market proportions based on the respective ICLS versions applied in each survey, and compares them with all years coded under the ICLS-13 framework. The relative changes are very small, indicating the low prevalence of **other forms of work** as defined at the beginning of this section.

*Note 1:* Starting in 2021, the survey began applying the **ICLS-19** framework.  

*Note 2:* For a clearer comparison, the analysis includes data only from 2017 onward.
