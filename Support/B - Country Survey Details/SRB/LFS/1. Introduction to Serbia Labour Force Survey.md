## What is the SRB LFS?
The Serbia Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official household-based survey conducted by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS). The survey was piloted in 1994 and conducted annually from 1995; in 2008 it was fielded twice a year (April and October). In 2014 it moved to quarterly enumeration, and since 2015 it has been implemented as a continuous quarterly survey aligned with EU-LFS/ILO standards. 

## What does the SRB LFS cover?
The survey collects information on demographics, education, and labour market activities in the reference week (employment, unemployment, inactivity), alongside standard labour topics such as occupation, industry, status in employment, hours, multiple jobholding and job search. Content follows EU-LFS/ILO concepts and has been implemented on a quarterly basis since 2014.

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are not publicly available. The datasets are provided to the World Bank by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. For World Bank users, access can be requested through the Jobs Group at gld@worldbank.org.

## What is the sampling procedure?
The SRB LFS uses a stratified two-stage cluster design. Primary sampling units are enumeration districts, stratified by type of settlement (urban/other) and the 25 districts. In the second stage, households are sampled within each selected enumeration district. Since 2014 the survey has been run quarterly; since 2015 it has been continuous with a rotation scheme that keeps overlap between quarters. 

The survey produces statistically representative estimates at the national level, with standard disaggregations by region and urban/rural 


## Other noteworthy aspects

### Data availability
Data availability varies across years. Between 2008 and 2013, the survey was conducted twice a year, specifically in April and October. Starting in 2014, the survey’s periodicity changed to a quarterly schedule.

As a result, for 2011, only the April round is available, while for 2018, two quarters (corresponding to April and October) are available. The availability of data in other years follows this same pattern depending on whether the survey was biannual or quarterly during that period.

### Household ID
Household identifiers in the LFS are constructed from sample and geographic identifiers (e.g., ED and household number) provided in the raw files; individuals are linked through person numbers within household. From 2013 to 2018, we do not have enough information to construct the household ID variable. 


### Employment concept
To define employment in the LFS up to 2020, the survey followed the specifications outlined in its methodology and reports [see 2011 report](utilities/SRB%202011%20LFS%20Report.pdf). According to the report, an individual is considered employed if:
```
Employed persons are the persons that in the week observed did some work for remuneration (in 
money or in kind), as well as the persons with job i.e. employment who in the respective week were absent 
from work. Apart from the persons who contracted employment and work with enterprises, institutions or other organizations or are active as sole entrepreneurs, here included are individual agricultural producers, 
supporting household members, as well as the persons who found and contracted (in verbal or in written) a 
casual job execution, without contracting employment and to whom the subject jobs were the only source of 
subsistence. Therefore, the Survey does not relate to the formal working status of the surveyed population, but the working status is determined on the basis of the real activity that interviewed person practiced in the respective week.
```

It is important to highlight certain aspects that require deeper clarification than what is provided in the report’s definition, as they become evident when reviewing the questionnaire flow.

A person who has a job but was absent from work during the reference week due to a temporary suspension of work or the off-season for seasonal employment is considered employed if they are expected to return to their job after the period of absence and the duration of that absence does not exceed three months.
If the absence lasts more than three months, the person is still classified as employed only if they continue to receive at least 50% of their regular net wage during that period.

It is important to note that for 2020, although the question on absence and salary is included in the questionnaire, the raw data do not contain the variable referring to payment during absence.
Therefore, only for this year, individuals who were absent from work for more than three months but intended to return to their job could considered employed regardless of whether they received less than 50% of their net wage.

LFS general: 

```
replace lstatus = . if UKTRAJOD == 3 | (UKTRAJOD == 2 & inlist(ZARADA50,1,2))
```
LFS 2020

```
replace lstatus = . if UKTRAJOD == 3 
```
This adjustment is not expected to materially affect the results, even if complete information were available, and it does not introduce significant differences compared to other years.

In addition, for the case of unemployment, the 2011 LFS report defines it as follows:

```
Unemployed persons are persons who did not perform any paid job in the reference week nor 
held a job from which they were absent and to which they could to return after the absence, provided that 
they met the following criteria: 
• They took active steps in the past four weeks in finding a job and they were ready to begin 
working within two weeks in case of a job offer; 
• They did not actively seek a job in the past four weeks because they had found a job they were 
to start after the reference week, and not later than three months. 
```

Starting in 2021, the definition of employment changed in accordance with the ICLS-19 standards. For those interested in further details, the following section provides a more in-depth explanation.

### How recode to ICLS-13
To define employment, the LFS follows the ICLS-13 definition. Beginning in 2021, LFS adopted the updated standards introduced in the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). For details on these new concepts, please refer to the [ILO website](https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/description-work-statistics-icls19/).The procedure used to ensure comparability with earlier rounds is described in [this document](Conversion%20from%20ICLS-19%20to%20ICLS-13%20version.md).

### Industry and occupation classifications
We coded industry and occupation data using internationally recognized standards — the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) and the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO).

To keep the data comparable across years, we include below a table showing the specific versions of each classification used in every survey year.

| Year | ISIC Version | ISCO Version |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| 2008 | Rev.3 | 1988 |
| 2009 | Rev.3 | 1988 |
| 2010 | Rev.3 | 1988 |
| 2011 | Rev.4 | 1988 |
| 2012 | Rev.4 | 1988 |
| 2013 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2014 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2015 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2016 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2017 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2018 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2019 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2020 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2021 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2022 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2023 | Rev.4 | 2008 |
| 2024 | Rev.4 | 2008 |

For the 2010 survey, the April round used the ISIC Rev.3 classification for industry, while the October round used ISIC Rev.4. However, the raw data include information from the October round coded under both versions. Therefore, we worked with ISIC Rev.3 for this year.
