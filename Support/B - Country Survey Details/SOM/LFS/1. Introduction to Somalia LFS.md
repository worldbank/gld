## What is the SOM LFS?

The Somalia Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the second national labour force survey, conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. This survey updates the information from the 2014 Mogadishu Labour Force Survey and provides statistics and indicators on the main characteristics of the country???s labour force.

## What does the SOM LFS cover?

he Somalia Labour Force Survey (LFS) collects data on demographic characteristics (age, sex, location), education levels, labour market activities, employment status, and unemployment, as well as underemployment, labour migration, remittances, and participation in training programs. It also captures information on economic activity by sector, occupation, informal employment, and persons outside the labour force, with disaggregation by sex, age, and urban/rural areas. The 2019 LFS, conducted between March and December 2019. The years and sample size of harmonized GLD are:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **Officially Reported Sample Size(# HH)**	| 
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	| :-------:	| 
| 2019 | 4,544         | 27,411      |  7,258,464  |   7,258,464   |

## Where can the data be found?

Publicly available data and documentation for the Somalia Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2019 can be found on the Somalia National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) [Microdata Portal](https://microdata.nbs.gov.so/index.php/catalog/57/get-microdata). However, the weights in the public dataset differ from those used in the official NBS report. For this purpose, the NBS shared the original microdata with the World Bank. These microdata may circulate internally within the World Bank but cannot be publicly released as microdata.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Somalia Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2019 used a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design with independent strata for each of the 18 pre-war regions (Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sool, Sanaag, Bari, Nugaal, Mudug, Galgaduud, Hiraan, Middle Shabelle, Banaadir, Lower Shabelle, Bay, Bakool, Gedo, Middle Juba, and Lower Juba). Within each region, clusters (primary sampling units) were selected using Probability Proportional to Size (PPS), with Enumeration Areas (EAs) defined from the 2014 Population Estimation Survey for Somalia (PESS) mapping as the sampling frame. A total of 300 clusters were selected, each containing 15 households, yielding a sample of 4,500 households

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official Somalia [LFS 2019 report](utilities/LFS Report_2019.pdf) details results by gender, urban/rural sector, and region (the 18 pre-war regions of Somalia). Nomadic populations and areas inaccessible due to security concerns were excluded from the sampling frame, so results are representative only for the covered population

## Other noteworthy aspects


### Survey Coverage and Representativeness

The Somalia LFS 2019 did not include the nomadic population nor the regions of Lower Shabelle and Middle Juba. Therefore, the information is representative only for urban, rural, and IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) populations in the covered regions. The sampling design was based on the 2014 Population Estimation Survey for Somalia (PESS), ensuring consistency with official statistics, although the comparability with later LFS rounds or other surveys is limited. The table below summarizes the expanded population coverage, LFS 2019 captured 59% of the total population estimated in PESS 2014.

| **Total population (PESS 2014)** | **Total population (LFS 2019)** |
|:-------------------------------: |:-------------------------------:|
| 12,316,895                       | 7,258,464                       |


The exclusion of nomadic populations and entire regions introduces systematic biases in the national estimates. For instance, employment in agriculture is likely underestimated, while employment in services may be overestimated, given the different economic structures of the excluded populations.

### Education system in Somalia

The Somalia education system follows a 6-3-3 structure, comprising six years of primary education, three years of intermediate (lower secondary), and three years of secondary (upper secondary). Before primary school, many children attend Quranic education (2???3 years), which focuses on the teaching and memorization of the Quran and often provides basic literacy and numeracy skills; however, it is usually not considered part of the formal education system. After completing secondary education, students may pursue post-secondary non-tertiary programs, typically lasting two years, or continue to university for a bachelor???s degree, which usually takes four years. This information is essential for constructing the variable `educy`, which measures the total number of years spent in education, and `educat7`, which classifies the highest level of education attained into seven categories. The table below summarizes the average duration in years or grades for each level of education.

| **Level**                    | **Duration ??? Grades**   | **Duration ??? Years** |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Quranic                        | -                       | 2 or 3 years           |
| Primary                        | Year 1 to 4             | 4 years                |
| Lower secondary                | Year 5 to 8             | 5 years                |
| Upper secondary                | Year 9 to 12            | 4 years                |
| Post-secondary non-tertiary     | -                       | 2 years                |
| University (bachelor???s degree)  | -                       | 4 years                |
