## What is the MKD LFS?  
The North Macedonia Labor Force Survey (LFS) is the official household-based survey conducted by the State Statistical Office (SSO). It was introduced in 1996, initially as an annual survey during the transition period and aligned with EU-LFS/ILO methodology; since 2004 it has been conducted on a continuous quarterly basis and follows international standards (ILO, EU-LFS). 

## What does the MKD LFS cover?  
The survey collects information on demographics (age, sex, marital status, location), education, and labor market activities in the reference week. 

The harmonized years and sample sizes available for GLD are:

## Where can the data be found?  
The microdata are available on request from the State Statistical Office of North Macedonia. For World Bank users, the datasets are accessible through the Jobs Group by formal request to gld@worldbank.org.

## What is the sampling procedure?  
The MKD LFS employs a **stratified two-stage sampling design**. Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) are [DESCRIPTION – e.g., census enumeration areas], selected with probability proportional to size, stratified by [REGIONS/URBAN–RURAL]. Households are selected in the second stage using systematic random sampling.  

The survey was initially conducted [ANNUALLY/SEMI-ANNUALLY], and from [YEAR] it transitioned to a [QUARTERLY/CONTINUOUS] design. The shift introduced [CHANGES – e.g., rotation, updated census frame].  

## What is the geographic significance level?  
The survey provides representative estimates at the **national level**, and disaggregations are available by **urban and rural areas** as well as by **regions**.
