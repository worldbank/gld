## Where can the data be found?  
The microdata are available on request from the State Statistical Office of North Macedonia. For World Bank users, the datasets are accessible through the Jobs Group by formal request to gld@worldbank.org.

## What is the sampling procedure?  
The MKD LFS employs a stratified, rotational, two-stage sampling design. Primary sampling units are census enumeration districts, stratified by region and by urban or rural status. In the second stage, households are selected within each sampled district.  

The survey was carried out annually from 1996. Since 2004 it has been conducted as a continuous quarterly survey, following the EU-LFS methodology and using a rotation scheme for households. The sampling frame during this period was based on the 2002 Population Census.


## What is the geographic significance level?  
The survey provides representative estimates at the **national level**, and disaggregations are available by **urban and rural areas** as well as by **regions**.
