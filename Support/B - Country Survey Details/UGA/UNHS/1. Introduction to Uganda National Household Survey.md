## What is the UNHS?
The Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) is a nationally representative household survey program conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The UNHS is implemented in repeated rounds and is UBOS’s primary instrument for collecting comprehensive socio-economic information on households and individuals for national monitoring and policy analysis, including poverty and labor market related indicators.

## What does the UNHS cover?
The UNHS collects information on household demographics and a broad set of socio-economic topics. Core content typically includes household composition and characteristics, education, health, housing conditions, household assets, consumption and expenditure, income and livelihoods, and labor market activity.

| Round | Household count | Individual count |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| UNHS 2023/24 | 17,315 |  86,137 |

The 2023-24 UNHS round also includes a refugee component designed to produce statistics that are comparable for refugees and host communities. Of the 17,315 households, 1,555 households are refugees while the reamining are non-refugees. 

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Researchers can request access through the UBOS Microdata Library ([link here](https://microdata.ubos.org/index.php/catalog)).

## What is the sampling procedure?
The UNHS is a household-based survey program. The sampling approach is typically a stratified, multi-stage cluster design based on a national census sampling frame. In general terms, enumeration areas are selected in the first stage (often with probability proportional to size) within strata defined by geography and urban or rural location, and households are then selected systematically within each sampled enumeration area. Specific sample sizes, stratification domains, and estimation levels vary by round and should be documented per round when writing harmonization notes.

## What is the geographic significance level?
Uganda is organized into four major regions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. These regions contain smaller administrative units including districts and subregions.

For UNHS-based harmonization, subnational identifiers are typically constructed to support national estimates, urban and rural breakdowns, and subnational reporting domains as defined in each survey round (for example, subregions used in the survey reporting). The exact subnational reporting level can differ by round.
