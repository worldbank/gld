## What is the UNHS?
The Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) is a nationally representative household survey program conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The UNHS is implemented in repeated rounds and is UBOS’s primary instrument for collecting comprehensive socio-economic information on households and individuals for national monitoring and policy analysis, including poverty and labor market related indicators.

## What does the UNHS cover?
The UNHS collects information on household demographics and a broad set of socio-economic topics. Core content typically includes household composition and characteristics, education, health, housing conditions, household assets, consumption and expenditure, income and livelihoods, and labor market activity.

| Round | Household count | Individual count |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| UNHS 2023/24 | 17,315 |  86,137 |

The 2023-24 UNHS round also includes a refugee component designed to produce statistics that are comparable for refugees and host communities. Of the 17,315 households, 1,555 households are refugees while the reamining are non-refugees. 

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Researchers can request access through the UBOS Microdata Library ([link here](https://microdata.ubos.org/index.php/catalog)).

## What is the sampling procedure?
The UNHS is a household-based survey program. The sampling approach is typically a stratified, multi-stage cluster design based on a national census sampling frame. In general terms, enumeration areas are selected in the first stage (often with probability proportional to size) within strata defined by geography and urban or rural location, and households are then selected systematically within each sampled enumeration area. Specific sample sizes, stratification domains, and estimation levels vary by round and should be documented per round when writing harmonization notes.

## What is the geographic significance level?
Uganda is organized into four major regions, which are Central, Eastern, Northern and Western. These regions contain smaller subregions and districts, with districts serving as the main local government units. 

For this harmonization, `subnatid1` is assigned to the four major regions and `subnatid2` is assigned to the detailed subnational units reported in each survey round, which are the fifteen subregions in the 2021 NLFS and the seven regions in the 2016-17 NLFS. The survey reports disaggregate labor market estimates at the `subnatid2` level and by urban/rural.



## Other noteworthy aspects

### Defining the labor force
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey follows labor status definitions that are aligned with the international standards of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). In both the 2016–17 and 2021 rounds, the survey applies concepts of employment and unemployment consistent with the ICLS framework, including the criteria for identifying persons in employment, those in unemployment, and those outside the labor force.

For more information on how the employed and unemployed individuals are identified, refer to this [page](Identifying%20the%20labor%20force.md)

### Subnational ID

One difference between the 2016-17 and 2021 rounds is that the sub-regions `subnatid2` does not represent the same type of area in 2016–17 and 2021. In the 2016–17 NLFS, `subnatid2` identifies seven broad regions: Kampala, peri-urban Kampala, other central, Eastern, Karamoja, Northern, and Western. In the 2021 NLFS, `subnatid2` identifies fifteen sub-regions: Kampala and fourteen named sub-regions such as Buganda South, Teso, West Nile, Ankole, and others.

The table below shows how each 2021 sub-region sits within the broader 2016–17 regional domains. The mapping is intentionally at the higher regional level, since the 2016–17 survey does not distinguish Buganda South and Buganda North as separate domains.

For the Central area, the 2016–17 survey distinguishes three domains: Kampala, peri-urban Kampala, and other central. The 2021 survey distinguishes Kampala, Buganda South, and Buganda North. There is no one-to-one mapping between peri-urban Kampala or other central and either Buganda South or Buganda North. The only safe harmonized unit is Central excluding Kampala. In 2016–17, this is the combination of peri-urban Kampala and other central. In 2021, this is the combination of Buganda South and Buganda North.

Because of these design differences, `subnatid2` cannot be compared directly between 2016–17 and 2021. For geographic disaggregation comparing between the two years, use `subnatid1`, which correspond to the 4 regions consistently.
