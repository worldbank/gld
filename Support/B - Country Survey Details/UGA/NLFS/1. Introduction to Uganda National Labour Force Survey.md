## What is the UGA NLFS?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey is a nationally representative labor survey conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Before its introduction, labor statistics in Uganda were produced through smaller surveys that focused mainly on the urban population. The first dedicated National Labor Force Survey was launched in 2011 and established a regular system for collecting comprehensive information on employment, unemployment, and labor market activity across the entire country. The GLD includes the 2016-17 and 2021 rounds of the survey. Both rounds follow international standards and apply the definitions of employment and unemployment set by the 20th International Conference of Labor Statisticians (ICLS).

## What does the UGA NLFS cover?
The NLFS collects information on demographics, education, and detailed labour market characteristics, including employment, unemployment, hours worked, status in employment, occupation, industry, underemployment, education, and youth and child labour. Note that the working-age population applied in the reports is defined as persons aged 14–64, consistent with Uganda’s national definition. 

The harmonized years available for GLD are:

| Year | # Persons | # Households | 
|------|------------|--------------|
| 2016/17 | 20,795 | 4,829 |
| 2021 | 48,418  | 9,659 |

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Researchers can request access through the UBOS Microdata Library ([link here](https://microdata.ubos.org/index.php/catalog)). For World Bank users, datasets are provided through the regular internal channels. You may also reach out to the [GLD Team](mailto:gld@worldbank.org?subject=UGA%20Data%20Question).

## What is the sampling procedure?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey uses a stratified two stage cluster sampling design based on the latest Population and Housing Census frame. In the first stage, enumeration areas are selected with probability proportional to size within strata defined by region or sub region and by urban or rural location. In the second stage, a fixed number of households is selected systematically within each sampled enumeration area and all eligible members are interviewed. The design expanded between the 2016 and 2021 rounds. The number of primary sampling units increased from 360 enumeration areas with 5,400 households to 1,100 enumeration areas, and the stratification domains shifted from seven broad labor market regions to fifteen sub-regions and the main cities. This improved the precision and geographic detail of subnational estimates.

## What is the geographic significance level?
Uganda is organized into four major regions, which are Central, Eastern, Northern and Western. These regions contain smaller subregions and districts, with districts serving as the main local government units. 

For this harmonization, `subnatid1` is assigned to the four major regions and `subnatid2` is assigned to the detailed subnational units reported in each survey round, which are the fifteen subregions in the 2021 NLFS and the seven regions in the 2016-17 NLFS. The survey reports disaggregate labor market estimates at the `subnatid2` level and by urban/rural.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Defining the labor force
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey follows labor status definitions that are aligned with the international standards of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). In both the 2016–17 and 2021 rounds, the survey applies concepts of employment and unemployment consistent with the ICLS framework, including the criteria for identifying persons in employment, those in unemployment, and those outside the labor force.

For more information on how the employed and unemployed individuals are identified, refer to this [page](Identifying%20the%20labor%20force.md)

### Comparability between the 2016–17 and 2021 NLFS rounds
Comparability between the 2016–17 and 2021 NLFS rounds is affected by differences in fieldwork timing and by the broader context of the COVID pandemic. The 2016–17 survey enumeration took place between November 2016 and June 2017. The 2021 round collected data between June and December 2021. Fieldwork in 2021 was interrupted by a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown from 18 June to 30 July 2021, during which face-to-face interviews were suspended and then resumed after restrictions were lifted. Also, there are small differences in how labor status is defined as detailed in this [page](Identifying%20the%20labor%20force.md)


### Subnational ID

One difference between the 2016-17 and 2021 rounds is that the sub-regions `subnatid2` does not represent the same type of area in 2016–17 and 2021. In the 2016–17 NLFS, `subnatid2` identifies seven broad regions: Kampala, peri-urban Kampala, other central, Eastern, Karamoja, Northern, and Western. In the 2021 NLFS, `subnatid2` identifies fifteen sub-regions: Kampala and fourteen named sub-regions such as Buganda South, Teso, West Nile, Ankole, and others.

The table below shows how each 2021 sub-region sits within the broader 2016–17 regional domains. The mapping is intentionally at the higher regional level, since the 2016–17 survey does not distinguish Buganda South and Buganda North as separate domains.

| `subnatid1`  | 2021 sub-region (`subnatid2`) | Closest 2016–17 domain (`subnatid2`)                  |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 - Central  | 1 - Kampala                   | 1 - Kampala                                            |
| 1 - Central  | 2 - Buganda South             | 2/3 - Central (Peri-urban Kampala and Other central)  |
| 1 - Central  | 3 - Buganda North             | 2/3 - Central (Peri-urban Kampala and Other central)  |

| 3 - Northern | 10 - Acholi                   | 6 - Northern                                           |
| 3 - Northern | 11 - West Nile                | 6 - Northern                                           |
| 4 - Western  | 12 - Bunyoro                  | 7 - Western                                            |
| 4 - Western  | 13 - Toro                     | 7 - Western                                            |
| 4 - Western  | 14 - Ankole                   | 7 - Western                                            |
| 4 - Western  | 15 - Kigezi                   | 7 - Western                                            |


For the Central area, the 2016–17 survey distinguishes three domains: Kampala, peri-urban Kampala, and other central. The 2021 survey distinguishes Kampala, Buganda South, and Buganda North. There is no one-to-one mapping between peri-urban Kampala or other central and either Buganda South or Buganda North. The only safe harmonized unit is Central excluding Kampala. In 2016–17, this is the combination of peri-urban Kampala and other central. In 2021, this is the combination of Buganda South and Buganda North.

Because of these design differences, `subnatid2` cannot be compared directly between 2016–17 and 2021. For geographic disaggregation comparing between the two years, use `subnatid1`, which correspond to the 4 regions consistently. 

### Duplicate issues in the UGA 2016/17 NLFS person identifier

The UGA 2016/17 NLFS data had two types of issues relating to duplicates in the person identifier: **true duplicates** and **misassigned IDs**.

#### 1) True duplicates (the same person recorded more than once)

True duplicates are cases where the dataset contains more than one record that appears to refer to the*same individual within the same household. We identified two forms:

- **Complete duplicates (exact repeats):** two records are identical across all variables. These are clearly accidental repeats and can be dropped safely.
- **Demographic duplicates (same basic profile, different answers):** two records within the same household share the same basic demographic profile (age, sex, and relationship to the household head) but have different responses for some items. In principle, two different people could share the same demographic profile (for example, twins of the same sex living in the same household). In practice, this is highly unlikely to explain the observed patterns at scale, so we treat these as duplicate records of the same person and resolve them by keeping the more complete record.

As shown in the table below , we found **40 records** that were complete duplicates (20 duplicate sets) and **24 records** that were demographic duplicates (12 duplicate sets). For demographic duplicates, we retained the record with the highest number of non-missing responses and dropped the less complete record.

#### 2) Misassigned person IDs (different people share the same person ID)

Misassigned IDs are cases where **different household members were given the same person ID**, even though their basic demographic characteristics do not match. These are not duplicate people; they are valid individuals with an ID problem. Therefore, these records should not be dropped. Instead, the fix is to construct a revised within-household person identifier that assigns a unique and consistent ID to each household member.

As shown in the table below, we found **145 records** in this category (70 duplicate sets). Note that the duplicate counts are computed at different stages of cleaning: after removing some repeat records, some previously duplicated IDs become unique (or smaller duplicate groups), so the totals change.

---
| No | Item | Records | Sets | Code | Solution |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Total number of duplicates in person ID | 198 | 91 | `duplicates tag ha8name ha10 ha11 pid` | — |
| 2 | Complete duplicates | 40 | 20 | `duplicates tag` | Drop the duplicates |
| 3 | Duplicates in demographic information | 24 | 12 | `duplicates tag ha8name ha10 ha11 pid age sex hb4` | Drop the duplicate with the lower number of non-missing responses |
| 4 | Duplicates but with distinct demographic characteristics | 145 | 70 | `duplicates tag ha8name ha10 ha11 pid`<br>`duplicates tag ha8name ha10 ha11 pid age sex hb4` | Re-order the person ID variable |
