## What is the UGA NLFS?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey is a nationally representative labor survey conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Before its introduction, labor statistics in Uganda were produced through smaller surveys that focused mainly on the urban population. The first dedicated National Labor Force Survey was launched in 2011 and established a regular system for collecting comprehensive information on employment, unemployment, and labor market activity across the entire country. The GLD includes the 2016-17 and 2021 rounds of the survey. Both rounds follow international standards and apply the definitions of employment and unemployment set by the 20th International Conference of Labor Statisticians (ICLS).

## What does the UGA NLFS cover?
The NLFS collects information on demographics, education, and detailed labour market characteristics, including employment, unemployment, hours worked, status in employment, occupation, industry, underemployment, education, and youth and child labour. The working-age population is defined as persons aged 14–64, consistent with Uganda’s national definition. 

The harmonized years available for GLD are:

| Year | # Persons | # Households | 
|------|------------|--------------|
| 2016/17 | 20,795 | 4,829 |
| 2021 | 48,418  | 9,659 |

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Researchers can request access through the UBOS Microdata Library ([link here](https://microdata.ubos.org/index.php/catalog)). For World Bank users, datasets are provided through the Jobs Group at gld@worldbank.org.

## What is the sampling procedure?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey uses a stratified two stage cluster sampling design based on the 2014 Population and Housing Census frame. In the first stage, enumeration areas are selected with probability proportional to size within strata defined by region or sub region and by urban or rural location. In the second stage, a fixed number of households is selected systematically within each sampled enumeration area and all eligible members are interviewed. The design expanded between the 2016 and 2021 rounds. The number of primary sampling units increased from 360 enumeration areas with 5,400 households to 1,100 enumeration areas, and the stratification domains shifted from seven broad labor market regions to fifteen sub-regions and the main cities. This improved the precision and geographic detail of subnational estimates.

## What is the geographic significance level?
Uganda is organized into four major regions, which are Central, Eastern, Northern and Western. These regions contain smaller subregions and districts, with districts serving as the main local government units. 

For this harmonization, `subnatid1` is assigned to the four major regions and `subnatid2` is assigned to the detailed subnational units reported in each survey round, which are the fifteen subregions in the 2021 NLFS and the seven regions in the 2016-17 NLFS. The survey reports disaggregate labor market estimates at the `subnatid2` level and by urban/rural.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Defining the labor force
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey follows labor status definitions that are aligned with the international standards of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). In both the 2016–17 and 2021 rounds, the survey applies concepts of employment and unemployment consistent with the ICLS framework, including the criteria for identifying persons in employment, those in unemployment, and those outside the labor force.

### Comparability between the 2016–17 and 2021 NLFS rounds
Comparability between the 2016–17 and 2021 NLFS rounds is affected by differences in fieldwork timing and by the broader context of the COVID pandemic. The 2016–17 survey covered a full twelve month cycle, while the 2021 round collected data only from June to October. Fieldwork in 2021 was also interrupted by a nationwide lockdown in July, which delayed interviews and compressed the effective data collection window. These differences create seasonality concerns because labour market activity can vary across months, and any observed changes between rounds may reflect timing effects rather than underlying trends. The 2021 survey was conducted in a pandemic period and labor market conditions were influenced by mobility restrictions, school closures, and disruptions to service sector activity. This context may also have affected response patterns and survey operations. For these reasons, comparisons between 2016–17 and 2021 should be interpreted with caution.

### Duplicates in the 2016-17 survey
The UGA 2016/17 NLFS data had two types of issues relating to duplicates in the person identifier. 

**1. True person duplicates.** These refer to cases where the same individual was recorded more than once in the dataset. Detection relied on matching the raw person ID in combination with age, sex, and relationship to the household head. Most cases were exact repeats: multiple observations carrying identical demographic and labor market information. A smaller set showed identical demographics but conflicting answers to labor market questions. In these situations, the observation with the highest number of non missing responses was retained. This approach prioritizes the record containing the fullest information and minimizes the loss of labor market detail. Any resulting bias is negligible because these duplicates involve only twelve unique individuals.

**2. Same person ID assigned to completely different people** This issue reflects a mis-use of the raw person ID within some households. Different household members were assigned the same number even though their demographic characteristics did not match. These observations are valid household members and should not be dropped. The resolution is to create a revised within household person identifier that assigns a unique and consistent ID to each individual in households affected by this problem.
