## What is the UGA NLFS?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey (NLFS) is a nationally representative, stand-alone labour survey conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). It complements earlier labour modules in the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) and the Urban Labour Force Survey. Modern NLFS rounds—2011/12, 2016/17, and 2021—follow International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and are aligned with the 20th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) concepts on employment and labour underutilization.

## What does the UGA NLFS cover?
The NLFS collects information on demographics, education, and detailed labour market characteristics, including employment, unemployment, hours worked, status in employment, occupation, industry, underemployment, informality, NEET, and youth and child labour. The 2021 round also included new modules on forced labour, international migration and outflows, and dependent contracting relationships. The working-age population is defined as persons aged 14–64, consistent with Uganda’s national definition. The harmonized years available for GLD are:

| Year | # Persons | # Households | # Weighted Persons | WDIPopulation |
|------|------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 2016/17 | To be added | To be added | To be added | To be added |
| 2021 | 39,522 | 8,668 | To be added | To be added |

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Researchers can request access through the UBOS Microdata Library ([link here](https://microdata.ubos.org/index.php/catalog)). For World Bank users, datasets are provided through the Jobs Group at gld@worldbank.org.

## What is the sampling procedure?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey uses a stratified two stage cluster sampling design based on the 2014 Population and Housing Census frame. In the first stage, enumeration areas are selected with probability proportional to size within strata defined by region or sub region and by urban or rural location. In the second stage, a fixed number of households is selected systematically within each sampled enumeration area and all eligible household members are interviewed. Between the 2016/17 and 2021 rounds, the design was scaled up: the number of primary sampling units increased from 360 enumeration areas (with 5,400 sampled households) to 1,100 enumeration areas (with 9,121 sampled households and 8,668 completed interviews), and the stratification domains were refined from seven broad labour market regions to fifteen sub regions and the main cities, improving the precision and geographic detail of subnational estimates.

The 2021 NLFS was conducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures. Fieldwork took place between June and December 2021 and was temporarily suspended during the nationwide lockdown from 18 June to 30 July 2021, then resumed once restrictions were eased. As a result, the survey captures labour market conditions during a period of partial restrictions and gradual reopening rather than a “normal” year.  These circumstances have two main implications for interpretation. First, changes in employment, unemployment, hours worked, and sectoral composition between 2016/17 and 2021 reflect both underlying structural trends and the short- to medium-term impact of COVID-19 and related policy measures. Second, some groups—such as workers in contact-intensive services, informal urban workers, and those affected by school closures and mobility restrictions—may be disproportionately represented in transitions between employment, unemployment, and inactivity. Comparisons over time should therefore be made with caution, treating 2016/17 as a pre-pandemic baseline and 2021 as a pandemic-affected reference point rather than a fully comparable steady-state year.

## What is the geographic significance level?
Uganda is organized into four major regions, which are Central, Eastern, Northern and Western. These regions contain smaller subregions and districts, with districts serving as the main local government units. This structure provides the framework used in most national statistical reporting. For this harmonization, subnatid1 is assigned to the four standard regions and subnatid2 is assigned to the detailed subnational units reported in each survey round, which are the fifteen subregions in the 2021 NLFS and the seven regions in the 2016 and 2017 NLFS. The survey is representative at the subnatid2 level, in line with the official reports that present labor market statistics using this level of disaggregation.
