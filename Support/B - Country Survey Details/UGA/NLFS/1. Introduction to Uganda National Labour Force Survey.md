## What is the UGA NLFS?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey (NLFS) is a nationally representative, stand-alone labour survey conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). It complements earlier labour modules in the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) and the Urban Labour Force Survey. Modern NLFS rounds—2011/12, 2016/17, and 2021—follow International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and are aligned with the 20th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) concepts on employment and labour underutilization.

## What does the UGA NLFS cover?
The NLFS collects information on demographics, education, and detailed labour market characteristics, including employment, unemployment, hours worked, status in employment, occupation, industry, underemployment, informality, NEET, and youth and child labour. The 2021 round also included new modules on forced labour, international migration and outflows, and dependent contracting relationships. The working-age population is defined as persons aged 14–64, consistent with Uganda’s national definition. 

The harmonized years available for GLD are:

| Year | # Persons | # Households | 
|------|------------|--------------|
| 2016/17 | 20,795 | 4,829 |
| 2021 | 48,418  | 9,659 |

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Researchers can request access through the UBOS Microdata Library ([link here](https://microdata.ubos.org/index.php/catalog)). For World Bank users, datasets are provided through the Jobs Group at gld@worldbank.org.

## What is the sampling procedure?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey uses a stratified two stage cluster sampling design based on the 2014 Population and Housing Census frame. In the first stage, enumeration areas are selected with probability proportional to size within strata defined by region or sub region and by urban or rural location. In the second stage, a fixed number of households is selected systematically within each sampled enumeration area and all eligible household members are interviewed. Between the 2016/17 and 2021 rounds, the design was scaled up: the number of primary sampling units increased from 360 enumeration areas (with 5,400 sampled households) to 1,100 enumeration areas, and the stratification domains were refined from seven broad labour market regions to fifteen sub regions and the main cities, improving the precision and geographic detail of subnational estimates.

## What is the geographic significance level?
Uganda is organized into four major regions, which are Central, Eastern, Northern and Western. These regions contain smaller subregions and districts, with districts serving as the main local government units. 

For this harmonization, `subnatid1` is assigned to the four major regions and `subnatid2` is assigned to the detailed subnational units reported in each survey round, which are the fifteen subregions in the 2021 NLFS and the seven regions in the 2016-17 NLFS. The survey reports disaggregate labor market estimates at the `subnatid2` level and by urban/rural.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Defining the labor force
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey follows labor status definitions that are aligned with the international standards of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). In both the 2016–17 and 2021 rounds, the survey applies concepts of employment and unemployment consistent with the ICLS framework, including the criteria for identifying persons in employment, those in unemployment, and those outside the labor force.

### Covid-19 implications
The 2021 NLFS was conducted during the COVID-19 period and its fieldwork months do not align with those of the 2016–17 NLFS. These differences introduce two key caveats when comparing estimates across the two rounds. First, the surveys cover different months of the year, so observed changes may partly reflect seasonality rather than true shifts in labour market conditions. Second, data collection in 2021 took place under COVID-19 restrictions, which may have affected response patterns, survey operations, and measurement error. As a result, comparisons between 2016–17 and 2021 should be interpreted with caution.


### Duplicates in the 2016-17 survey
The UGA 2016/17 NLFS showed two distinct issues with the person ID. The first involved true duplicates where the same individual appeared more than once. These were detected by matching the raw person ID together with age, sex, and relationship to the household head. Twenty complete duplicates were removed, and twenty four additional clusters were identified as representing the same individual with different amounts of recorded information. For each set of duplicates, the observation with more non-missing variables is retained. The second issue involved the mis-use of the person ID in the raw dataset. Different individuals in the same household had been assigned the same id number despite having different demographic characteristics. These cases reflected valid household members and were not removed. Instead, they were addressed later by constructing a revised within household person identifier that assigns a unique and consistent ID to every individual in the dataset.
