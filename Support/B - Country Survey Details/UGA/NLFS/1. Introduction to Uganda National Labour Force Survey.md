## What is the UGA NLFS?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey is a nationally representative labor survey conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Before its introduction, labor statistics in Uganda were produced through smaller surveys that focused mainly on the urban population. The first dedicated National Labor Force Survey was launched in 2011 and established a regular system for collecting comprehensive information on employment, unemployment, and labor market activity across the entire country. The GLD includes the 2016-17 and 2021 rounds of the survey. Both rounds follow international standards and apply the definitions of employment and unemployment set by the 20th International Conference of Labor Statisticians (ICLS).

## What does the UGA NLFS cover?
The NLFS collects information on demographics, education, and detailed labour market characteristics, including employment, unemployment, hours worked, status in employment, occupation, industry, underemployment, education, and youth and child labour. Note that the working-age population applied in the reports is defined as persons aged 14–64, consistent with Uganda’s national definition. 

The harmonized years available for GLD are:

| Year | # Persons | # Households | 
|------|------------|--------------|
| 2016/17 | 20,795 | 4,829 |
| 2021 | 48,418  | 9,659 |

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Researchers can request access through the UBOS Microdata Library ([link here](https://microdata.ubos.org/index.php/catalog)). For World Bank users, datasets are provided through the regular internal channels. You may also reach out to the [GLD Team](mailto:gld@worldbank.org?subject=UGA%20Data%20Question).

Kindly note that we have experience issues with the link to the UBOS Microdata Catalog. Users are advised to check the [general UBOS website](https://www.ubos.org/).

## What is the sampling procedure?
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey uses a stratified two stage cluster sampling design based on the latest Population and Housing Census frame. In the first stage, enumeration areas are selected with probability proportional to size within strata defined by region or sub region and by urban or rural location. In the second stage, a fixed number of households is selected systematically within each sampled enumeration area and all eligible members are interviewed. The design expanded between the 2016 and 2021 rounds. The number of primary sampling units increased from 360 enumeration areas with 5,400 households to 1,100 enumeration areas, and the stratification domains shifted from seven broad labor market regions to fifteen sub-regions and the main cities. This improved the precision and geographic detail of subnational estimates.

## What is the geographic significance level?
Uganda is organized into four major regions, which are Central, Eastern, Northern and Western. These regions contain smaller subregions and districts, with districts serving as the main local government units. 

For this harmonization, `subnatid1` is assigned to the four major regions and `subnatid2` is assigned to the detailed subnational units reported in each survey round, which are the fifteen subregions in the 2021 NLFS and the seven regions in the 2016-17 NLFS. The survey reports disaggregate labor market estimates at the `subnatid2` level and by urban/rural.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Defining the labor force
The Uganda National Labor Force Survey follows labor status definitions that are aligned with the international standards of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). In both the 2016–17 and 2021 rounds, the survey applies concepts of employment and unemployment consistent with the ICLS framework, including the criteria for identifying persons in employment, those in unemployment, and those outside the labor force.

For more information on how the employed and unemployed individuals are identified, refer to this [page](Identifying%20the%20labor%20force.md)

### Comparability between the 2016–17 and 2021 NLFS rounds
Comparability between the 2016–17 and 2021 NLFS rounds is affected by differences in fieldwork timing and by the broader context of the COVID pandemic. The 2016–17 survey enumeration took place between November 2016 and June 2017. The 2021 round collected data between June and December 2021. Fieldwork in 2021 was interrupted by a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown from 18 June to 30 July 2021, during which face-to-face interviews were suspended and then resumed after restrictions were lifted.


### Duplicates in the 2016-17 survey
The UGA 2016/17 NLFS data had two types of issues relating to duplicates in the person identifier: true duplicates (1) and misassigned IDs (2).

**1. True person duplicates.** These refer to cases where the same individual was recorded more than once in the dataset. Duplicates cases (identified by age, sex, and relationship to the household head) were reduced to the set of variables used in the harmonization and checked for duplication. Most cases were true duplicates and could be dropped. In the subset of cases with some diverging answers, the observation with the highest number of non-missing responses was retained. This approach prioritizes the record containing the fullest information and minimizes the loss of labor market detail. Any resulting bias is negligible because these duplicates involve only twelve unique individuals.

**2. Same person ID assigned to completely different people** This issue reflects a misuse of the raw person ID within some households. Different household members were assigned the same number even though their demographic characteristics did not match. These observations are valid household members and should not be dropped. The resolution is to create a revised within household person identifier that assigns a unique and consistent ID to each individual in households affected by this problem.
