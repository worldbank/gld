# Identifying the labor force in the UGA NLFS

## Defining the employed

In the Uganda National Labour Force Survey, individuals are classified as employed if, during the seven days preceding the interview, they either performed at least one hour of work in a market oriented activity or had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent. This approach follows the spirit of the [19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians definition](https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/description-work-statistics-icls19/) of employment in market oriented production and is applied consistently across the main work modules of the questionnaire.

### 1. Paid employees

Paid employees are classified as employed if they worked for someone else for pay or in kind during the reference week. This includes any wage, salary, commission, or payment in kind received for at least one hour of work as an employee. Respondents who report that they did not work in the last seven days but give a recognised short term reason for absence such as vacation, public holiday, sickness, maternity or paternity leave, training, temporary layoff with expectation of return, strike, or bad weather are also classified as employed, since they retain a job to which they are expected to return. 

One important difference between the 2016–17 NLFS and the 2021 NLFS is that the 2016–17 round does not ask how long the respondent has been out of work or whether they expect to return to the job within three months, whereas the 2021 NLFS includes explicit questions on duration of absence and expected return; in the 2016–17 data we therefore infer job attachment solely from the reported short term reason for absence.

### 2. Own account workers and business owners

Individuals are classified as employed if they operated a business or economic activity for sale or profit on their own or with partners during the reference week. This group consists of own account workers and business owners. Respondents who did not work in their business in the last seven days but report a short term absence for one of the standard reasons listed above are also treated as employed, since they remain attached to an ongoing enterprise that is expected to continue.

### 3. Contributing family workers

Contributing family workers are counted as employed if they worked without pay in a household business or enterprise that produces goods or services for sale during the reference week. Unpaid family helpers who usually work in such a business but did not work in the last seven days are also considered employed if they report one of the recognised short term absence reasons. This reflects continued attachment to the household enterprise even when no work was carried out in the reference week.

### 4. Apprentices

Apprentices are treated as employed if they performed any work in an apprenticeship arrangement during the reference week, regardless of whether they received cash earnings. Apprentices who did not work in that week but report a standard short term reason for absence from their usual apprenticeship duties are also classified as employed because they are expected to resume their work with the same employer or within the same apprenticeship arrangement.

### 5. Market oriented agricultural workers

Household members engaged in agricultural activities are classified as employed if they worked on the household farm, livestock, forest, or fishery during the reference week and the resulting output is reported as mainly or only intended for sale or barter rather than primarily for own household use. Agricultural workers who did not work in the last seven days but report a temporary absence from such market oriented farm work for a recognised short term reason are similarly treated as employed. The questionnaire structure implies that farmers who supervise hired workers on farms that produce for sale are captured within these categories, but our operational coding relies only on whether any work was done and whether the agricultural output is mainly or only for sale, without applying a separate condition based explicitly on the use of hired labour.

### 6. Main status and secondary work

The employment classification does not restrict attention to respondents whose self reported main status is work. Individuals who describe their main status as student, homemaker, retired, or otherwise not primarily working are still classified as employed if they meet any of the work or temporary absence conditions described above. This ensures that secondary and occasional market work is fully captured in the employment measure used for the Uganda National Labour Force Survey.


## Defining the unemployed

An individual is classified as unemployed if three conditions are met. First, they do not satisfy any of the criteria for employment described above, that is, they did not work in the reference week and do not have a job or business from which they are temporarily absent. Second, they have demonstrated active labour market attachment either by looking for work or by setting up a future job or business. In the survey this includes respondents who, during the past four weeks, report that they looked for a job, tried to start a business, already found a job that will start at a later date, or have taken all necessary steps to start a business that will begin in the future. Third, they are available to start work, which is captured by questions asking whether they could have started a job or a business during the reference week if an opportunity had been offered. Only individuals who are not employed, who have engaged in recent job search or have a concrete future job or business arrangement, and who state that they could have started work in the reference week are classified as unemployed. All remaining respondents are considered to be outside the labour force.
