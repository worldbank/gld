# Introduction to Rwanda Labor Force Survey (RWA LFS)

## What is the RWA LFS?

The Rwanda LFS has been conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) of Rwanda since August 2016. Adopting the framework set by the 19th International Conference of Labor Statistics ("ICLS-19"), the questionnaire is aimed to gather information on household roster characteristics, education, employment, primary and secondary economic activities in the past week, previous employment, own-use production of goods and services, and household assets.  Before 2019, it was a bi-annual survey conducted on February and August of the same year to capture seasonal changes in agriculture. Since then, it was rolled out as a quarterly survey that included additional rounds for May and November. Despite these changes, the questionnaire was unchanged with the exception of the May 2020 round where an abridged version was used.

## What does the RWA LFS cover?

The Rwanda LFS is a labor force survey with information on demographic characteristics, education, and labor market activities over the past 7 days. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:

| Year | HH count | Individual count |
|---|---|---|
| 2017 |          17,938  |                      77,761  |
| 2018 |          17,861  |                      76,670  |
| 2019 |          19,325  |                      81,778  |
| 2020 |          16,718  |                      70,172  |
| 2021 |          17,085  |                      71,947  |


## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are accessible to the public and researchers have to detail their purposes of using data to the [Rwanda National Institute of Statistics (NIS)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog). 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Rwanda LFS is designed as a stratified two-stage sampling survey. All 30 districts of Rwanda, subdivided into urban and rural constitute the strata. The primary sampling units were selected with probability proportional to size from enumeration areas laid out in the 2012 Census sampling frame. There were 16 households sampled in each enumeration area (EA), except when there are fewer than 16 households living in the EA. 

The Rwanda LFS uses a rotation sampling design that differs between the 2016-2018 and 2019-2021 rounds. In the 2016-18 rounds, the sample is split equally into four rotation groups where one group is replaced by a new one every round. Thus, on a round-to-round basis, 75% of the sample is retained. In the rounds starting February 2019, the design follows a 1-1-1 scheme such that each household in a sampling group is interviewed every other quarter three times prior to replacement.

## What is the significance level?

The harmonized datasets contain a weight variable that is meant to generate annual estimates at the district level. 

## Adjustments during the Covid-19 pandemic

There were adjustments made in the 2020 Rwanda LFS in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Phone interviews were done for the May and November 2020 rounds, both of which comprise the same sampling group. Also, an abridged version was used in the May 2020 round where only basic household information and labor status were collected. For this reason, the Rwanda NIS recommends that full year estimates only be calculated for the few indicators available in the May round. 

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Household ID

The datasets received contain ID information. In the GLD project, we have created IDs to provide the best user experience based on geographic identifiers. The household ID is formed based on information on the primary sampling unit and household identifier. 

### Discrepancies between the questionnaire and variables in the raw datasets

While the Rwanda LFS questionnaire remains largely unchanged over time, there were certain instances when the raw datasets do not contain the universe of variables implied by the questionnaire. These missing variables are detailed [here](Missing%20variables.md).

### Deriving key employment variables

The Rwanda LFS reports contain detailed guidance on how to calculate key employment variables, including labor status, underemployment, potential labor force and earnings. This process is documented [here](XXX.md).

### Minimum age for education and labor questions

Education and labor questions were asked only for respondents aged 14 and above. This differs from the Rwanda NIS reports, which reports employment indicators for individuals aged 16 and above. Rwanda labor laws require that only individuals can only begin employment at the age of 16 but permitted apprenticeships for those between 13 and 15 years old.  

### Employment: Industry Classification

The Rwanda LFS follows a customized version of the ISIC version 4 called CISIC (see [here](utilities/RWA_CISIC.pdf)). However, there were codes that cannot be found in both the CISIC and ISIC version 4. The closest digit available was used when coding ISIC correspondence. For example, industry code "5111" was mapped to "5110". 

### Employment: Occupation Classification

The Rwanda LFS follows a customized version of the ISCO 2008 called CISCO (see [here](utilities/RWA_CISCO.pdf)). However, there were codes that cannot be found in both the CISCO and ISCO 2008. The closest digit available was used when coding ISCO correspondence. For example, occupation code "2213" was mapped to "2200" since no valid ISCO code can be found for the 3-digit equivalent, "2210".
