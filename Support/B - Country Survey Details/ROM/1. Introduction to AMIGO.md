## What is the ROM AMIGO?

The Household Labour Force Survey (AMIGO) is a nationally representative, household-based sample survey conducted on a quarterly basis by the National Institute of Statistics Romania (INS) since 1996.

## What does the ROM AMIGO cover?

The AMIGO Survey provides quarterly and annual labour market indicators. It targets the working-age population and collects detailed information on individuals’ employment status, job characteristics, and economic activities during a reference week. The survey offers essential insights into the structure and dynamics of the labour force, including indicators of employment, unemployment, underemployment, and labour force participation.

The survey focuses on private households and excludes collective or institutional households such as retirement homes, military barracks, and prisons. It is conducted through face-to-face interviews using a household questionnaire.

The target population of the survey consists of individuals residing in private households. The survey covers persons with usual residence in Romania for a period of at least 12 months who are members of households in the selected dwellings.

The Global Labour Database (GLD) harmonization currently includes the 2020 to 2023 rounds. The years and their corresponding sample sizes of the harmonized AMIGO are:


| **Year** | **Households Interviewed** | **Individuals Interviewed**  | **Expanded Population**  | **Official Sample Size (Households)** |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| 2020     | 89,785                      | 213,586                     | 19,314,265               | 19,314,265                            |
| 2021     | 90,968                      | 213,982                     | 19,075,177               | 19,075,177                            |
| 2022     | 91,441                      | 213,412                     | 18,932,775               | 18,932,775                            |
| 2023     | 91,109                      | 212,632                     | 18,874,634               | 18,874,634                            |


## Where can the data be found?

The data used in this project were shared with the Global Labour Database team by colleagues in the World Bank country office in Romania. All data are classified as Official Use Only: they may be used internally within the World Bank but are not authorized for external distribution.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The survey is based on a nationally representative random sample of dwellings, using a two-stage sampling design. In the first stage, primary sampling units are selected from the Multifunctional Sample of Territorial Areas (EMZOT), which is constructed from the 2011 Population and Housing Census and periodically updated. In the second stage, dwellings are selected within these units, covering all households residing in the selected dwellings. The sample is representative of the population living in private households by area, sex, and age group, with weighting adjustments applied to correct for non-response and align the sample with population distributions derived from exhaustive demographic sources.

The survey follows a rotating panel design (2–2–2 scheme), under which dwellings are interviewed for two consecutive quarters, excluded for the following two quarters, and reintroduced for two additional quarters before permanent removal. Each dwelling is therefore surveyed over six quarters and interviewed four times. This rotation scheme ensures sample continuity across quarters and years, reduces respondent burden and non-response, improves the precision of change estimates over time, and enhances the consistency of quarterly and annual labour market indicators.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The AMIGO is designed to be representative at the regional level across the eight administrative divisions of the country (Nord-Vest, Centru, Nord-Est, Sud-Est, Sud-Muntenia, Bucuresti-Ilfov, Sud-Vest Oltenia, Vest), with results disaggregated by urban and rural areas.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Data Availability
For the AMIGO Survey, the data shared with GLD do not correspond directly to the original survey microdata. Instead, they are based on an adaptation produced by Eurostat, which includes harmonized variables derived from the original AMIGO survey variables. Despite this transformation, the adapted datasets allow for the construction of the key variables required for GLD analysis.

For detailed information on the variables available for each year, please refer to the corresponding [data dictionary](utilities/data_dictionary/index.md)

### ICLS- 19
The 2020 follows the ICLS-13 classification, while the 2021 onwadrs round adopts the updated ICLS-19 standards. 

### Migration Covergae
Migration-related information available in GLD for the AMIGO Survey is limited to individuals who previously resided abroad. As a result, the harmonized dataset captures international migration only, while internal (national) migration is not covered due to the absence of variables identifying changes of residence within Romania.

Consequently, migration indicators derived from the GLD-harmonized data should be interpreted as reflecting international movements exclusively and do not provide a comprehensive measure of internal residential mobility.


### Type of economic activity
To classify economic activity, the Tajikistan Labour Force Survey uses the OKVED (Russian Classification of Types of Economic Activity), which is aligned with the NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) up to the 4-digit level. The 5th and 6th digits of OKVED refer to country-specific activities. The 2009 LFS used OKVED Rev 1.1, while the 2016 LFS used OKVED Rev 2. The following table presents a correspondence between the relevant classification versions:

| **OKVED**   | **NACE**   | **ISIC**   |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Rev 1.1     | Rev 1.1    | Rev 3.1    |
| Rev 2       | Rev 2      | Rev 4      |

NACE and ISIC have a perfect correspondence at the 2-digit level. From the 3 and 4 digit levels, adjustments are required. For this purpose, the GLD team made a [correspondence table](utilities/NACE_to_ISIC.xlsx), showing the specific changes made to move from NACE to ISIC.


### Employment Questions Order and Impact on Results

This survey has a special feature, the order of the questions in the main activity section matters. Figure 1 displays LFS 2009 and 2016 questions related to the activities performed by respondents. If they answer affirmatively to any of these questions, they are directed to the employment-related section under the assumption that this is their main job.


<div align="center"><strong>Figure 1: LFS current Activity questions</strong></div>

| LFS 2009          |  LFS 2016 |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|![labour_questions_2009](utilities/current_activity_questions_2009.PNG)  |  ![labour_questions_2016]( utilities/current_activity_questions_2016.PNG)|


Upon the first affirmative response, the individual is specifically asked about that job. It is not possible to know information about other types of work. Commonly, if the survey determines a person eligible to be asked about employment in various ways (i.e., they have various jobs) the enumerator asks about the job that the respondent devotes the most time to. Here the order determines the selection.

### Origin of the 2009 LFS

Upon reviewing the 2009 data, no official report could be found, as expected. Furthermore, according to ILOSTAT, labor force participation for that year is not reported under a labor force survey (LFS). Instead, the 2008 round is labeled as an LFS, while 2009 is categorized as a [living standards survey](https://rshiny.ilo.org/dataexplorer69/?lang=en&segment=indicator&id=EAP_DWAP_SEX_AGE_RT_A) (see image below). This discrepancy raises questions about the true nature and methodology of the 2009 survey.

While some annual data are available on the Tajikistan official statistics [website](http://data.stat.tj/Home/index2/14?lang=en), the source and classification of these figures remain unclear. Notably, the values reported on the national site do not match those published by ILO, further highlighting inconsistencies in the data. Given these uncertainties, it is important to acknowledge the lack of clarity regarding the origin and classification of the 2009 survey data.


### Weight Variable Selection – LFS 2016

The LFS 2016 raw data includes several weight variables. To determine the most appropriate one, we conducted the following analysis.

First, we reviewed the dataset that includes all individuals. Figure 2 shows the total population using the weights from the full individual-level dataset.

<div align="center"><strong>Figure 3: Total Population - Persons data</strong></div>

<figure>

<img src="utilities/raw_ind_weights_2016.PNG" alt="raw_ind_weights_2016"/>

</figure>

According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), Tajikistan's population in 2016 was approximately 8.8 million (see Figure 3). This suggests that the variables ```weight``` and ```weightFinal``` from the full dataset closely reflect the national population.

<div align="center"><strong>Figure 4: Total Population - WDI</strong></div>

<figure>

<img src="utilities/pop_wdi_2016.PNG" alt="pop_wdi_2016" style="width:60%;" />

</figure>

Next, we analyzed the questionnaire dataset, which includes only individuals aged 12 to 75—the target population for the LFS. Figure 4 shows the population totals using weights from this dataset. For comparison, Figure 5 shows the same calculation using the full individual-level dataset, restricted to the 12–75 age group.

The questionnaire dataset includes slightly more individuals and displays a lower average weight. Additionally, in the full dataset, the average values of ```weight``` and ```weightfinal``` differ slightly, whereas in the questionnaire dataset, their averages are exactly the same.

<div align="center"><strong>Figure 5: Total Population - questionnarie data </strong></div>

<figure>

<img src="utilities/raw_ind_weights_12to75_2016.PNG" alt="raw_ind_weights_12to75_2016"/>

</figure>

We selected ```weightfinal``` from the questionnaire dataset as the main weight variable. For individuals missing from that dataset, we filled in the weights using ```weightFinal``` from the full individual-level dataset.


### How recode to ICLS-19

The 2009 Labour Force Survey follows the ICLS-13 classification, while the 2016 round adopts the updated ICLS-19 standards. For more details on the changes introduced in ICLS-19,please see [here on the ILO website](https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/description-work-statistics-icls19/).

Although it is not feasible to revert the 2016 data to the earlier classification, it is possible to align the 2009 data with the ICLS-19 framework. To ensure comparability between both rounds, selected adjustments can be made to the employment coding, supported by the questionnaire structure. The specific harmonization procedures are detailed in a separate [document.](icls13to19.md) 


### Education System in Tajikistan

In Tajikistan, education is organized into three stages: basic education, secondary education, and tertiary education. The table below shows the average duration, in years, of each stage. This information is useful for creating the variable ```educy```, which codes the number of years spent in education, and the variable ```educat7```, which classifies the highest level of education attained by the respondent into seven categories.

| Education Level                                     | Years   | Observations                                   |
