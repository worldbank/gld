## What is the ROM AMIGO?

The Household Labour Force Survey (AMIGO) is a nationally representative, household-based sample survey conducted on a quarterly basis by the National Institute of Statistics Romania (INS) since 1996.

## What does the ROM AMIGO cover?

The AMIGO Survey provides quarterly and annual labour market indicators. It targets the working-age population and collects detailed information on individuals’ employment status, job characteristics, and economic activities during a reference week. The survey offers essential insights into the structure and dynamics of the labour force, including indicators of employment, unemployment, underemployment, and labour force participation.

The survey focuses on private households and excludes collective or institutional households such as retirement homes, military barracks, and prisons. It is conducted through face-to-face interviews using a household questionnaire.

The target population of the survey consists of individuals residing in private households. The survey covers persons with usual residence in Romania for a period of at least 12 months who are members of households in the selected dwellings.

The Global Labour Database (GLD) harmonization currently includes the 2020 to 2023 rounds. The years and their corresponding sample sizes of the harmonized AMIGO are:


| **Year** | **Households Interviewed** | **Individuals Interviewed**  | **Expanded Population**  | **Official Sample Size (Households)** |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| 2020     | 89,785                      | 213,586                     | 19,314,265               | 19,314,265                            |
| 2021     | 90,968                      | 213,982                     | 19,075,177               | 19,075,177                            |
| 2022     | 91,441                      | 213,412                     | 18,932,775               | 18,932,775                            |
| 2023     | 91,109                      | 212,632                     | 18,874,634               | 18,874,634                            |


## Where can the data be found?

The data used in this project were shared with the Global Labour Database team by colleagues in the World Bank country office in Romania. All data are classified as Official Use Only: they may be used internally within the World Bank but are not authorized for external distribution.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The survey is based on a nationally representative random sample of dwellings, using a two-stage sampling design. In the first stage, primary sampling units are selected from the Multifunctional Sample of Territorial Areas (EMZOT), which is constructed from the 2011 Population and Housing Census and periodically updated. In the second stage, dwellings are selected within these units, covering all households residing in the selected dwellings. The sample is representative of the population living in private households by area, sex, and age group, with weighting adjustments applied to correct for non-response and align the sample with population distributions derived from exhaustive demographic sources.

The survey follows a rotating panel design (2–2–2 scheme), under which dwellings are interviewed for two consecutive quarters, excluded for the following two quarters, and reintroduced for two additional quarters before permanent removal. Each dwelling is therefore surveyed over six quarters and interviewed four times. This rotation scheme ensures sample continuity across quarters and years, reduces respondent burden and non-response, improves the precision of change estimates over time, and enhances the consistency of quarterly and annual labour market indicators. For further details, please refer to the AMIGO 2020 report [report](utilities/labour_force_in_romania_2020_0.pdf) 

## What is the geographic significance level?

The AMIGO is designed to be representative at the regional level across the eight administrative divisions of the country (Nord-Vest, Centru, Nord-Est, Sud-Est, Sud-Muntenia, Bucuresti-Ilfov, Sud-Vest Oltenia, Vest), with results disaggregated by urban and rural areas.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Data Availability
For the AMIGO Survey, the data shared with GLD do not correspond directly to the original survey microdata. Instead, they are based on an adaptation produced by Eurostat, which includes harmonized variables derived from the original AMIGO survey variables. Despite this transformation, the adapted datasets allow for the construction of the key variables required for GLD analysis. For detailed information on the variables available for each year, please refer to the corresponding [data dictionary](utilities/data_dictionary/Index_Data_Dictionary.md).

### ICLS versions
The 2020 AMIGO Survey follows the ICLS-13 classification, while survey rounds from 2021 onwards adopt the ICLS-19 standards. Based on the information available, it is not possible to convert labour market–related variables between the ICLS-13 and ICLS-19 classifications in either direction. Users should exercise caution when comparing labour market indicators across survey years that span the two classification frameworks.

### Migration Covergage
Migration-related information available in GLD for the AMIGO Survey is limited to individuals who previously resided abroad. As a result, the harmonized dataset captures international migration only, while internal (national) migration is not covered due to the absence of variables identifying changes of residence within Romania.

Consequently, migration indicators derived from the GLD-harmonized data should be interpreted as reflecting international movements exclusively and do not provide a comprehensive measure of internal residential mobility.

### Employment Status in 2021

Under the GLD harmonization framework, the employment status variable (`empstat`) is classified into four categories: **employees**, **non-paid employees**, **employers**, and **self-employed**.

However, in the 2021 raw data, the categories **employers** and **self-employed** are merged into a single group, making it impossible to distinguish between these two employment types. As a result, this combined group is classified as **self-employed** in the harmonized dataset. This decision was taken to minimize bias, given that self-employment represents the predominant category in other survey years.

The figure below illustrates the distribution of the `empstat` variable across the available years.

### Income–Age Relationship

GLD provides information on wages for paid employees for the years 2022 and 2023. However, an unusual pattern emerges in the data: individuals classified as retired appear to earn higher wages than other population groups.

| **AMIGO 2023** | |
| <img src="utilities/wage_age_2022.png"> | |

***Note: The graphs above display the median hourly wage among paid employees.***

A closer inspection of the data indicates that the number of observations for retired individuals is very small. Consequently, the estimated median hourly wages for this group are highly sensitive to outliers, which can lead to unusually high values in the distribution.


| Year | Age group | Median hourly wage | Sample size |
|:------:|:-----------:|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
| 2022 | Young     | 22.77              | 2,818       |
| 2022 | Adult     | 26.65              | 56,744      |
| 2022 | Senior    | 25.66              | 11,369      |
| 2022 | Retiree   | 32.08              | 15          |
| 2023 | Young     | 26.65              | 2,785       |
| 2023 | Adult     | 30.80              | 55,680      |
| 2023 | Senior    | 28.62              | 13,193      |
| 2023 | Retiree   | 35.53              | 27          |


### Education System in Romania

In Romania, the education system is organized into three main stages: primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. The table below presents the typical duration, in years, of each educational stage. This information is used to construct the variable educy, which measures the total number of years of education completed, and the variable educat7, which classifies the highest level of education attained by the respondent into seven categories.

| Education level                                                                 | Typical duration (years) |
