## What is the XKX LFS?  
The Kosovo Labor Force Survey (LFS) is the official household-based labor survey conducted by the Kosovo Agency of Statistics. It was introduced in 2001, following Kosovo’s post-1999 institutional builds and efforts to align with international labor statistics norms. The LFS was conducted annually from 2001 to 2009, and later transitioned to a quarterly frequency, currently producing labor market indicators consistent with ILO definitions.


## What does the XKX LFS cover?  
The Kosovo LFS collects information on demographic characteristics, education, and labor market activities in the reference week.  

The harmonized years and sample sizes available for the GLD are as follows:  

| Year | Individuals | Households | Weighted Population | Population (WDI) |

## Where can the data be found?  
The microdatasets were requested by the World Bank from the [Kosovo Agency of Statistics](https://ask.rks-gov.net/en/kosovo-agency-of-statistics). For World Bank users, the datasets are accessible through the Jobs Group by formal request to gld@worldbank.org.  


## What is the sampling procedure?  
The Kosovo LFS employs a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. At the first stage, census enumeration areas are selected from the national sampling frame with probability proportional to size, stratified by region and urban/rural status. At the second stage, households are systematically selected within each sampled enumeration area.  

Until 2011, the survey was carried out on an annual basis using independent samples each year. Starting in 2012, the LFS was restructured into a continuous quarterly design with a rotating sample. This allowed households to remain in the sample across multiple quarters, improving the ability to measure both net and gross changes in labor market indicators over time.

## What is the geographic significance level?  
The Kosovo LFS provides statistically representative estimates at the **national** level, with disaggregations available by **region** and by **urban and rural areas**.

## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Employment

In the Kosovo LFS, the treatment of work for own-use production has changed across survey years, affecting who is counted as employed. In 2003, individuals were considered employed in own-consumption activities only if they worked at least 15 hours during the reference week, excluding occasional or low-intensity subsistence work. In 2004 and 2005, the questionnaire expanded coverage by including anyone who engaged in such activities for at least one hour. By 2008, the definition narrowed again, counting only work for pay or profit and including farm work only if at least part of the production was intended for sale. Pure subsistence production was therefore excluded from employment in later rounds. These differences should be considered when comparing employment levels over time.

| Year(s) | Own-use production counted as employed? | Conditions in the questionnaire |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 2003     | Yes, but only if 15+ hours              | Own-consumption activities included only when 15 hours or more were worked in the reference week. |
| 2004–2005 | Yes                                   | Questionnaire explicitly includes any own-use production for at least one hour (aligned with the one-hour rule). |
| 2008 onwards     | No, unless for sale                    | Farm work counted only if part of the production is for sale; 100% subsistence work excluded. |

### Household ID  
Household IDs are determined by constructing them from geographic variables, including region, enumeration area, and household number. In the 2002 round, however, the World Bank received a shortened version of the LFS with limited variables available. Because there was not enough information to generate household identifiers, the HHID is left missing for that year. Instead, a running variable for person ID (pid) was created under the assumption that each observation corresponds to one individual.  

### Weights  
Annual weights are applied in the harmonized data. While the survey shifted from an annual to a continuous quarterly design in 2012, the raw data received only provided annual weights. This implies that the weight variable can be used consistently to report annual estimates across all available LFS years.

### Industry and Occupation Classifications  

**Industry**: The Kosovo LFS uses the national classification of economic activities based on **NACE**, which can be mapped to ISIC at the two-digit level. The correspondence has changed over time as follows:  

| Years       | Classification used in survey | Target classification (ISIC) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2002–2005   | NACE rev 1   | ISIC Rev. 3/3.1    |
| 2008 onwards| NACE rev 2  | ISIC Rev. 4   |

**Occupation**: Occupations are classified according to the **International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)**. The survey applied ISCO-1988 from 2002 to 2014, and ISCO-2008 from 2018 to 2022.

| Years       | Classification used in survey |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 2002–2014   | ISCO 1988  |
| 2008 onwards| ISCO 2008  |
