# What is the GEO HIS?

The Georgian (GEO) Household Integrated Survey (HIS) was introduced in Georgia in the second half of 1996 and has been conducted annually on a quarterly basis since then. The survey is a household-based sample survey conducted by the National Statistics Office of Georgia. It collects comprehensive data on household characteristics, including income, expenditures, demographic composition, education, health, housing, and access to services.

Until 2016, labor force indicators were also collected as part of the Household Integrated Survey (HIS). However, starting in 2017, labor market data began to be collected through a separate, independent Labor Force Survey (LFS), while the remaining household economic components were restructured into the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). More [details on the GEO LFS here](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/blob/main/Support/B%20-%20Country%20Survey%20Details/GEO/LFS/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Georgian%20LFS.md)

# What does the GEO HIS cover?

The survey collected comprehensive data on a wide range of socioeconomic indicators at the household level. Its scope included general information about household composition, detailed records on household expenses and consumption, and data on the employment status and income of individual household members. The survey also captured information on household transfers and income from property and savings, living conditions, agricultural harvests, and overall economic activity. Additionally, it gathered data on employment and incomes from work, as well as various forms of assistance and other household income sources.

# Where can the data be found?

The data from 2011 to 2016 are publicly available on the Georgia National Statistics Office website. The downloadable datasets include sub-datasets that cover different sections in the questionnaire—detailed description of variables is also available on the website.

# What is the sampling procedure?

The Household Integrated Survey employed a rotating panel design, with households interviewed quarterly in Tbilisi and nine major regions of Georgia: Kakheti, Tbilisi, Shida Kartli (including Mtskheta-Mtianeti), Kvemo Kartli, Mtskheta-Mtianeti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, Adjara, Guria, Samegrelo, and Imereti (including Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti).

The survey covered only the non-institutional population, and households were selected based on a multi-stage sampling frame designed to ensure statistical representativeness at both the national and regional levels. Each household in the sample was assigned a weight, reflecting the number of households it represents in the population—on average, around 600 households per sampled unit.

These weights were calculated as the inverse of the product of three selection probabilities: 

1. The probability of selecting a settlement (city/town/village)
2. The probability of selecting a sampling unit within that settlement  
3. The probability of selecting a household within that unit

Households remained in the sample for one year, being interviewed once each quarter. To maintain freshness in the sample, 1/12 of households were replaced each month, resulting in a complete renewal of the sample annually.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The survey is representative at the regional level with rural/urban division.
