# Changes in industry and occupation classification

In most years, the Thailand LFS have adopted the ISIC and ISCO to classify the industries and occupations of the respondents. While Thailand has its industrial classification system with different versions over the years, it has maintained to use the ISIC not until 2011 when it began using the Thailand Industrial Classification (TSIC) for 2009. On the other hand, Thailand does not have a country-specific occupational classification system and has always used the ISCO for occupational codes.

The changes in the occupational and industrial classification systems have occurred at the same time. Between 1985 and 2000, Thailand LFS adopted a localized version of ISCO 1958 and ISIC version 1. Starting 2001, it adopted the ISCO 1988 and ISIC version 3. And in 2011, it began using the ISCO 2008 and the TSIC 2009.

While the NSO reports that the LFS data between 1985 and 2000 are based on the ISCO 1958, there is a substantial number of codes that could not be mapped to the ISCO 1958 codes. We are not able to find a table that identifies the occupation titles that correspond to these localized ISCO 1958 codes, so we leave the occupation variables as missing.

You may find n unsuccessful attempt at mapping ISCO 58 as well as the files for converting TSIC to ISIC Rev. 3 [here under Additional Data](utilities/Additional%20Data/).
