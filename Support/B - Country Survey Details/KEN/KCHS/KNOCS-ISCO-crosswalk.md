## KNOCS 2000 to ISCO 1988 Crosswalk

Kenya’s official occupational classification is the **Kenya National Occupational Classification Standard (KNOCS)**. The KCHS 2020–2022 records occupations using the earlier KNOCS 200, which aligns reasonably well with ISCO-88 at the two-digit level, but there are several exceptions where KNOCS splits or combines groups differently (see the crosswalk below). To our knowledge, there is no official, publicly available KNOCS 2000 to ISCO-88 crosswalk. The mapping presented here should therefore be treated as a best-effort approximation designed to preserve comparability at higher aggregation levels, not as a definitive one-to-one correspondence for detailed occupational titles.

| KNOCS code | KNOCS name | ISCO-88 code | ISCO-88 name | Notes |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| 11 | Legislators And Constitutional Officials | 11 | Legislators and senior officials | Direct conceptual match at sub-major level (public leadership / senior officials). |
| 12 | Administrators And Senior Officials Of Special-Interest Organizations | 11 | Legislators and senior officials | KNOCS splits “senior officials” into multiple sub-majors; ISCO-88 keeps them in 11. |
| 13 | Corporate Managers | 13 | General managers | Direct match to ISCO-88 13 “General managers” (managerial roles across enterprises). |
| 14 | Non-Departmental Managers | 12 | Corporate managers | KNOCS separates manager types; ISCO-88 groups most managerial functions under 12 except top “general managers” (13). |
| 15 | Other Administrators And Managers | 12 | Corporate managers | Residual managers; best fit is ISCO-88 12. |
| 21 | Physical, Mathematical And Related Science Professionals | 21 | Physical, mathematical and engineering science professionals | Direct match by domain. |
| 22 | Computing Professionals | 21 | Physical, mathematical and engineering science professionals | ISCO-88 places computing professionals inside sub-major 21. |
| 23 | Engineering Science Professionals | 21 | Physical, mathematical and engineering science professionals | ISCO-88 places engineering professionals inside sub-major 21. |
| 24 | Health And Life Science Professionals | 22 | Life science and health professionals | Direct match by domain. |
| 25 | Teaching Professionals | 23 | Teaching professionals | Direct match by domain. |
| 26 | Legal Professionals | 24 | Other professionals | ISCO-88 does not give legal its own 2-digit sub-major; it sits inside “Other professionals.” |
| 27 | Social Science And Related Professionals | 24 | Other professionals | ISCO-88 places social science-related professional groups under “Other professionals.” |
| 28 | Business Professionals | 24 | Other professionals | ISCO-88 places business professionals under “Other professionals.” |
| 29 | Other Professionals | 21 | Physical, mathematical and engineering science professionals | This KNOCS residual is heterogeneous; in your earlier coding we grouped 29 with 21 as a pragmatic default. Treat as potentially misclassified; ideally map at 3-digit. |
| 31 | Engineering Technicians | 31 | Physical and engineering science associate professionals | Direct match (engineering technicians). |
| 32 | Medical And Health Science Associate Professionals | 32 | Life science and health associate professionals | Direct match (health associates). |
| 33 | Physical And Life Science Associate Professionals | — | — | Not mappable at 2-digit without error. KNOCS 33 spans ISCO-88 31 and 32; must map using 3-digit minor groups (example below). |
| 34 | Ship And Aircraft Controllers | 34 | Other associate professionals | Best fit at 2-digit is ISCO-88 34 (other associates); precise classification requires 3-digit/unit groups. |
| 35 | Business And Social Services Associate Professionals | 34 | Other associate professionals | ISCO-88 collapses these under 34 at 2-digit. |
| 36 | Administration Middle Level Personnel | 34 | Other associate professionals | Middle-level administrative associate roles map to 34 at sub-major level. |
| 37 | Primary And Pre-Primary Education And Other Teachers | 33 | Teaching associate professionals | Direct match to teaching associates at 2-digit. |
| 39 | Other Business, Social Services, Athletics, Sports And Related Workers | 34 | Other associate professionals | Residual associates; best fit is 34. |
| 41 | Secretaries And Office Clerks | 41 | Office clerks | Direct match by domain. |
| 42 | Client Oriented Clerks | 41 | Office clerks | ISCO-88 2-digit clerks split differs; at 2-digit this is safest under 41 unless you map at 3-digit. |
| 51 | Models, Shop Assistants And Demonstrators | 52 | Models, salespersons and demonstrators | Direct match by scope (sales/modeling/demonstration). |
| 52 | Personal And Protective Services Workers | 51 | Personal and protective services workers | Direct match by domain. |
| 53 | House Stewards, Caterers, Waiters And Related Workers | 51 | Personal and protective services workers | ISCO-88 groups these within personal services at sub-major 51. |
| 54 | Travel Attendants And Guides | 51 | Personal and protective services workers | ISCO-88 groups these within personal services at sub-major 51. |
| 61 | Farm Workers (Except Fish) | 61 | Market-oriented skilled agricultural and fishery workers | Direct match at sub-major (skilled ag). |
| 62 | Fishery Workers | 61 | Market-oriented skilled agricultural and fishery workers | ISCO-88 sub-major 61 includes skilled fishery workers; 2-digit does not separate. |
| 63 | Wildlife Workers | 61 | Market-oriented skilled agricultural and fishery workers | Best fit within skilled ag/fishery at 2-digit; 3-digit mapping may refine. |
| 64 | Hunters And Trappers | 61 | Market-oriented skilled agricultural and fishery workers | Best fit within skilled ag/fishery at 2-digit. |
| 65 | Other Skilled Farm, Fishery, Wildlife And Related Workers | 61 | Market-oriented skilled agricultural and fishery workers | Residual skilled ag/fishery. |
| 71 | Extraction And Building Trades Workers | 71 | Extraction and building trades workers | Direct match. |
| 72 | Metal, Machinery And Related Trades Workers | 72 | Metal, machinery and related trades workers | Direct match. |
| 73 | Precision Metal And Related Trades Workers | 72 | Metal, machinery and related trades workers | ISCO-88 does not give “precision metal” its own 2-digit; it sits inside 72. |
| 74 | Electrical And Electronic Equipment Mechanics And Fitters | 72 | Metal, machinery and related trades workers | At 2-digit, electrical/electronic trades are included in 72; refine using 3-digit if needed. |
| 75 | Food Processing And Related Trades Workers | 74 | Other craft and related trades workers | ISCO-88 groups food processing craft under 74 at 2-digit. |
| 76 | Woodworking Trades Workers | 74 | Other craft and related trades workers | Direct fit within “other craft” at 2-digit. |
| 77 | Textile, Garment And Related Trades Workers | 74 | Other craft and related trades workers | Direct fit within “other craft” at 2-digit. |
| 78 | Upholsterers, Pelt, Leather And Shoemaking Trades Workers | 74 | Other craft and related trades workers | Direct fit within “other craft” at 2-digit. |
| 79 | Other Production And Related Workers | 74 | Other craft and related trades workers | Residual craft/production; 2-digit best fit is 74. |
| 81 | Drilling And Mining Plant And Mineral Products Machine Operators | 81 | Stationary plant and related operators | Best fit at 2-digit (stationary plant). |
| 82 | Metal Processing Plant And Metal Working Machine Operators | 82 | Machine operators and assemblers | Direct match at 2-digit. |
| 83 | Wood Processing Plant And Wood, Rubber And Plastic Machine Operators | 82 | Machine operators and assemblers | ISCO-88 places these machine operators under 82 at 2-digit. |
| 84 | Chemical Processing Plant And Chemical Products Machine Operators | 82 | Machine operators and assemblers | In your code we grouped under 82 for 2-digit; could also be 81 depending on ISCO-88 minor group detail. Prefer 3-digit mapping if this distinction matters. |
| 85 | Power Production Plant Operators | 82 | Machine operators and assemblers | In your code we grouped under 82; borderline with 81 (stationary plant). Prefer 3-digit mapping if needed. |
| 86 | Food And Related Products Machine Operators | 82 | Machine operators and assemblers | Direct fit within machine operators at 2-digit. |
| 87 | Assemblers | 82 | Machine operators and assemblers | Direct match. |
| 88 | Drivers And Mobile Machinery Operators | 83 | Drivers and mobile plant operators | Direct match. |
| 89 | Other Plant And Machine Operators And Assemblers | 82 | Machine operators and assemblers | Residual; best fit 82. |
