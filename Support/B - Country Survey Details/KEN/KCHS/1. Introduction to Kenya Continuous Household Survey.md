## What is the KCHS?
The Kenya Continuous Household Survey Programme (KCHSP) is a continuous household survey framework run by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) to address persistent gaps in poverty and employment data.

Before KCHSP, KNBS relied on periodic household budget and welfare surveys (for example the Rural Household Budget Survey (RHBS), Urban Household Budget Surveys (UHBS), the Welfare Monitoring Survey (WMS), and the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS)). Labour indicators were often collected as modules inside other surveys (including KIHBS and the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) survey), and the last standalone labour force survey cited is the 1998 Labour Force Survey. 

KCHSP has two core modules: (1) a quarterly labour force module (i.e., Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) module under KCHSP) intended to update employment statistics and produce labour market indicators such as employment and unemployment, and (2) a quarterly household budget / consumption module for household consumption and poverty measurement. Unlike many countries where household consumption surveys and labour force surveys are implemented as separate surveys, the KCPH integrates both surveys within one continuous household survey framework.

## What does the KCHS cover?
KCHS integrates multiple questionnaire components, including a labor force module and household welfare-related modules.

| Year | # Persons | # Households |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 2020 |   84,859  |    19,884   |
| 2021 |   68,677  |    17,042   |
| 2022 |   71,239  |    17,894   |

## Where can the data be found?
Microdata access is cataloged through KNBS’s KeNADA portal for KCHS survey years.

## What is the sampling procedure?
KCHS is a stratified, multi-stage cluster sample drawn from the Kenya Household Master Sample Frame (KHMSF), which is based on the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census. The frame is stratified into 92 strata defined by county and urban/rural residence (with Nairobi and Mombasa treated as urban-only). Clusters (primary sampling units) are selected systematically with equal probability within each stratum, then randomized into four quarterly replicates. Within each selected cluster, a fixed number of households are sampled systematically using a random start from the KHMSF household listings. The design supports quarterly national estimates for labour indicators, while county-level estimates for labour and poverty indicators are produced using the pooled annual sample (12 months).

## What is the geographic significance level?
The official reports detail estimates at the national, urban/rural, and each of the 47 counties.
