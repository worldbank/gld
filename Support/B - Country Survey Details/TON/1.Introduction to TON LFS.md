# Introduction to TONGA Labor Force Survey (TON LFS)

## What is the TON LFS?

The Tonga Labor Force Survey (TON LFS), has been conducted by the Tonga Statistics Department and the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development (MTED). The survey has been conducted in three years: 2003, 2018 and 2023. The 2018 and 2023 versions follow the ILO international guidelines for Labor Force Surveys. The TON LFS primary objective was to provide labor market statiscs for development and enhance monitoring and evaluation of the Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF), Ministerial Strategic Plans , Budget briefs and Sustainable Development Goals linked to economic growth and unemployment.

## What does the TON LFS cover?
The TON LFS is a labor force survey with information on household roster characteristics, education, employment, primary and secondary economic activities in the past week, work history and characteristics of the unemployed and household living conditions. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:

| year | persons | households |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2018 | 12,089  | 2,239     |
| 2023 | 10,091  | 2,239     |

## Where can the data be found?
The datasets for the years 2018 and 2023 are not available to the public. Data Requests may be directed to the Statistics Department of the Tonga Goverment. 

## What is the sampling procedure?
The TON LFS uses stratified multi-stage sampling design. The population is divided into distrinct subgroups (by island) with similar characteristics. The island level information is used as stratification for sampling selection.

## What is the significance level?

The surveys are significant at the island, urban/rural and national levels.  

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Handicraft Industry and Other Agricultural Activities

1. Background: The Problem Identified
During the harmonization of the 2018 Tonga Labour Force Survey (LFS), the Global Labor Database (GLD) team discovered a data quality issue:

Several individuals who reported being employed were not captured in the survey’s industry and employment status questions.
This means that, although these respondents said they were working, the survey did not record what sector (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing) or employment status (e.g., self-employed, wage worker) they belonged to.

2. How the GLD Team Investigated
The GLD team conducted quality checks to understand why these gaps occurred.
They found that many of these “missing” employed individuals were likely working in agriculture or handicrafts (the latter being part of the manufacturing sector).
This conclusion was based on answers to other survey questions about agricultural activities, even if the main industry/employment status questions were left blank.
3. Reclassification Process
Using responses to specific questions about agricultural activities, the GLD team was able to reclassify these individuals:
Most were assigned to the agriculture sector if their answers indicated involvement in farming, fishing, or related work.
Others, especially those involved in handicrafts, were classified under manufacturing.
However, the information available for these respondents was less detailed than for others who answered all questions. For example, their exact type of agricultural or manufacturing activity might not be known.
4. Limitations and Ongoing Challenges
The level of detail for these reclassified individuals is not as granular as for other survey respondents. For example, while some respondents might be classified as “crop farmers” or “livestock producers,” those reclassified based on indirect questions might only be labeled as “agriculture” in general.
The handicrafts sector is particularly challenging, as the survey did not collect enough detailed information to distinguish between different types of handicraft activities.
5. Collaboration with Tonga NSO
The GLD team is working with the Tonga National Statistics Office (NSO) to:
Understand why these discrepancies occurred in the survey design or implementation.
Identify additional questionnaire items that could help more accurately classify respondents in future surveys.
Ensure that the harmonized data matches the official results reported by the NSO in national statistics.
6. Why This Matters
Accurate classification of employed individuals by industry and employment status is crucial for:
Understanding the structure of Tonga’s labor market.
Designing policies and programs targeted at specific sectors (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing).
Ensuring international comparability of labor statistics.
### Wage information
The raw microdata contains information on wages but it is structured in ranges (example : 1 USD to 500 USD). The GLD guidelines indicate that the level of information is not detailed enought to be reported in the GLD datasets. Below is the 2018 questionnaire ranges for wages.
