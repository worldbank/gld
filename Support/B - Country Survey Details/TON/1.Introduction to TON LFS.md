# Introduction to TONGA Labor Force Survey (TON LFS)

## What is the TON LFS?

The Tonga Labor Force Survey (TON LFS), has been conducted by the Tonga Statistics Department and the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development (MTED). The survey has been conducted in three years: 2003, 2018 and 2023. The 2018 and 2023 versions follow the ILO international guidelines for Labor Force Surveys. The TON LFS primary objective was to provide labor market statiscs for development and enhance monitoring and evaluation of the Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF), Ministerial Strategic Plans , Budget briefs and Sustainable Development Goals linked to economic growth and unemployment.

## What does the TON LFS cover?
The TON LFS is a labor force survey with information on household roster characteristics, education, employment, primary and secondary economic activities in the past week, work history and characteristics of the unemployed and household living conditions. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:

| year | persons | households |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2018 | 12,089  | 2,239     |
| 2023 | 10,091  | 2,239     |

## Where can the data be found?
The datasets for the years 2018 and 2023 are not available to the public. Data Requests may be directed to the Statistics Department of the Tonga Goverment. 

## What is the sampling procedure?
The Tunisia LFS uses a two-stage sampling design. The first step involves drawing districts with probability proportional to size based on the General Population and Housing Census from a pool of districts stratified by governorates and areas.  The second step involves randomly drawing a cluster containing an average between 15 and 35 households per district. 

## What is the significance level?

The surveys are significant at the island and national levels. Beginning 2007, the data is significant at the governorate (or state) level, made possible by the increased sample size throughout this period, with the exception of the 2011 survey where the data is significant only at the regional level. We do not have reports between 1997 and 2000, so we cannot determine the significant level of disaggregation. Because of the much lower sample size and to take a conservative stance, we suggest that the estimates are significant at the national level.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Handicraft Industry and Other Agricultural Activities

Tunisia is, for the years covered in GLD, divided into 24 governorates (or provinces), commonly grouped into seven geographical regions in the reports (see image below), which are not formal administrative divisions but are commonly used to describe different parts of the country. The governorates are further subdivided into districts, but the survey does not provide information at this level of detail. 


### Wage information
The raw microdata contains information on wages but it is structured in ranges (example : 1 USD to 500 USD). The GLD guidelines indicate that the level of information is not detailed enought to be reported in the GLD datasets. Below is the 2018 questionnaire ranges for wages.
