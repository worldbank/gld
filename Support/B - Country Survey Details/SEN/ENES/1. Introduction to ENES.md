# Introduction to Senegal labor force survey – Enquête Nationale sur l'Emploi (ENES)


## What is the SEN ENES?
SEN ENES stands for Enquête nationale sur l’Emploi au Sénégal (National Employment Survey of Senegal). It is a labor force survey (LFS) produced by ANSD and implemented on a quarterly basis (in the ILO survey catalog it is listed as a quarterly LFS series).

## What does the SEN ENES cover?

At a high level, ENES is a household / individual survey designed to measure core labor-market outcomes and characteristics. In the ILO catalog, ENES is documented to cover (among others):

- Labor force status (employment, unemployment, outside labor force)
- Labor market attachment and related aggregates
- Education, age, sex, marital status, disability (in aggregated forms)
- Economic activity / sector (ISIC Rev.4)
- Occupation (ISCO-08) and skill level
- Hours worked
- Earnings (e.g., monthly earnings, low hourly pay indicators)
- Status in employment and job characteristics (contract type, working-time arrangement, establishment size)
- Informality/formality (nature of job / unit of production)

Years and sample size of ENES harmonized for GLD are: 

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	|
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	|
| 2015  | 5,903   | 53,662         |  13,936,114      |
| 2017  | 9,504   | 61,966         |  8,530,574       |
| 2018  | 12,083  | 104,251        |  15,346,300      |
| 2019  | 11,730  | 98,442         |  14,936,831      |
| 2022  | 12,780  | 97,209         |  17,736,132      |
| 2023  | 12,596  | 93,456         |  18,135,492      |
| 2024  | 10,461  | 70,966         |  14,038,976      |

Note: 
2015 is an annual ENES round (not quarterly).
2017 T2 (Q2) microdata not available: The second quarter of 2017 (2017 T2/Q2) is not currently available for download from the usual microdata access channel. Available documentation suggests this round may not have been used in the construction of official/harmonized indicators, although there is an ENES Q2 statistical report for 2017. We are currently in discussion with the Senegal counterparts to clarify where the 2017 T2 microdata are stored and how access can be granted for analytical use.
2024 T4 (Q4) identifiers missing: The fourth quarter of 2024 (2024 T4/Q4) microdata are available, but the dataset is missing core household and person identifiers (household ID and personal ID). As a result, 2024 T4 cannot be reliably merged with other quarters for panel-like quarter concatenation or for consistent integration into the multi-quarter ENES series. We are engaging with the data providers to determine whether an updated version containing consistent IDs can be shared, or whether a crosswalk/merge key exists.

## Where can the data be found?

The ENES microdata are not publicly downloadable; they are shared directly by the Senegal country team for harmonization and analysis.

## What is the sampling procedure?

ENES uses a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling design. In general, the design can be described as: (1) selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from census enumeration areas / districts de recensement (DR), and (2) selecting households within selected PSUs.

Baseline design (ENES 2015 – annual “reference” round)
For the 2015 annual ENES, the documented sampling procedure is:
PSU selection (DR / enumeration districts): Households are sampled from districts de recensement (DR), which serve as the primary sampling units (PSUs). The sample is stratified by residence, distinguishing urban vs. rural, and further distinguishing urban Dakar from other urban centers (second stratification).
Household selection within PSU: Within each selected DR, a fixed number of households are selected (documentation indicates different take rates by residence type, e.g., 12 households per DR in urban areas and 18 households per DR in rural areas).
Overall target sample size: The theoretical sample for ENES is stated as ~6,000 households (with implementation-based deviations due to fieldwork/nonresponse).

How the sampling implementation changes across years (post-2015)
After the 2015 annual round, ENES is implemented as a quarterly survey, with a partial rotation structure:
Quarterly implementation + sample rotation: ANSD documentation for recent ENES rounds describes a design that renews about one-third of the sample each year, with a referenced sample size of 3,614 (for the quarterly framework).
 

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official ENES reports detail results by gender, sector (i.e., urban or rural), and administrative area. Region is the primary administrative level at which ENES is designed to be representative in earlier rounds (corresponding to Senegal’s 14 regions).

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Age is reported in brackets

In 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 the raw data collect age in grouped intervals (with different grouping schemes by year). In the harmonized data, age was imputed using the midpoint of each age group.

### Wage reporting relies heavily on brackets

In both 2015 and 2019, most workers—especially employees—report earnings using wage ranges rather than exact amounts (2015: ~64% of employed and ~99% of employees; 2019: ~53% of employed and ~52% of employees). Following GLD practice, no bracket-to-point wage imputation was performed because exact-wage reporters are not a clear majority (≥75%). Exact wages were retained where available; wages for bracket reporters were left missing.

### Missing quarter / incomplete annual coverage

ENES 2017 Q2 is not available to GLD. The harmonized file therefore includes Q1, Q3, and Q4 only.

### Subnational/urban variables missing in specific quarters

2017 Q4 is missing region (subnatid1) (under review; it may be recoverable from the household code).
Some quarters are missing urban/rural (urban) information (e.g., 2019 quarters where area is not recorded); these variables are left missing for the affected quarters.

### Industry and occupation not present despite being in the questionnaire

Although the questionnaires include industry/occupation questions, the corresponding variables are absent in the raw microdata for 2017 and 2018. Therefore, industry and occupation variables were set to missing in the harmonized dataset.

### Exact wage variable absent in some years

The exact wage variable is not available in the raw data for 2017 and 2018, so wage_no_compen is set to missing for those years.

### Low wage response rates

In 2022–2024, only ~10% of workers report wage/earnings information, resulting in substantial missingness in wage variables in the harmonized data (wage coverage is limited and estimates based on wages should be interpreted with caution).
