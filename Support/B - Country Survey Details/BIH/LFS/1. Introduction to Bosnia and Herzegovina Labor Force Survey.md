## What is the BIH LFS?
The Bosnia and Herzegovina Labor Force Survey (LFS) is  conducted by the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina in cooperation with Republic of Srpska Institute of Statistics and Federal Institute of Statistics. It was introduced in 2006, during the post-transition period and aligned with ILO and Eurostat (EU-LFS) methodology. The BIH LFS is an annual survey up until 2020 when it switched to a continuous quarterly survey producing quarterly results

## What does the BIH LFS cover?
The survey collects information on demographics, education, and labor market activities in the reference week. 

The harmonized years and sample sizes available for GLD are:

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata are available on request from the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Researchers may submit a formal request through the [Agency for Statistics](https://bhas.gov.ba/)). For World Bank users, datasets can be requested through the Jobs Group at gld@worldbank.org.

## What is the sampling procedure?  
The BIH LFS employs a stratified two-stage sampling design. At the first stage, enumeration areas are selected from the national Master Sample Frame, which was established in 2009 to support household surveys. These areas are stratified by entity, canton or region, and by urban or rural location. At the second stage, households are randomly selected within each chosen enumeration area and all household members are interviewed.  

## What is the geographic significance level?  
The BIH LFS provides statistically representative estimates at the national level, with disaggregations available by entity (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and Brčko District), by canton within the Federation, and by urban and rural areas. 

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Household ID  
Household identifiers are constructed using available geographic variables together with the household number provided in the data. However, in the 2020 LFS the necessary information was not included, making it impossible to derive a household ID variable for that year.  

### Education system
The education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina transitioned from an eight-year to a nine-year compulsory basic education program beginning 2004. The reform was implemented gradually by entities and cantons, extending the duration of basic education and lowering the school starting age from seven to six. By 2012, the nine-year system had been fully adopted nationwide. This change has no implications for harmonization, as the BIH LFS provides separate education categories that distinguish individuals who completed schooling under the previous eight-year system from those educated under the newer nine-year structure.

### Industry and occupation classifications

Industry uses the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC). Versions by year:

| Years     | ISIC classification |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 2006–2011 | ISIC Rev. 3 / 3.1   |
| 2012–onward | ISIC Rev. 4       |

Occupation uses the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). Versions by year:

| Years       | ISCO classification |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 2006 to 2010  | ISCO 1988           |
| 2011–onward | ISCO 2008           |
