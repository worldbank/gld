## What is the KAZ LFS survey?

The Kazakhstan Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a nationally representative household survey conducted by the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan. It was first implemented in 2001, and although we only have access to data from 2009 to 2013, the survey continues to be fielded, with the latest data available as of 2024.

The datasets for 2009 to 2013 are organized quarterly, and based on the repetition of person identifiers and consistency in individual characteristics across quarters, we believe the survey follows a rotating panel design. However, we have no official documentation to confirm this structure, and other panel harmonization efforts do not appear to include Kazakhstan LFS in their list of panel surveys.

## What does the KAZ LFS survey cover?

The LFS collects detailed information on **labor market status** and **demographic characteristics** for individuals **aged 15 and older** only. A separate **child labor module** was fielded in some years, but this module is **not available** in the World Bank datasets.

Below is a summary of sample sizes by year:

| Year | Persons | Households |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2009 | 208,173 | 85,920     |
| 2010 | 206,862 | 85,747     |
| 2011 | 203,821 | 83,820     |
| 2012 | 200,440 | 82,918     |
| 2013 | 196,073 | 83,670     |

In addition to standard labor force indicators (employment, unemployment, inactivity), the dataset includes:
- **Sector and occupation codes** (ISIC and ISCO)
- **Informality markers**
- **Working hours and underemployment**
- **Wage and income questions**

> Note: The employment and unemployment figures in the KAZ LFS **differ significantly from ILO-reported estimates**, often showing **much higher unemployment rates**. The source and construction method for these figures remain unclear. Further outreach to ILO contacts is ongoing to clarify this discrepancy.

> Also note: No data for 2008 could be harmonized due to missing documentation and unclear variable definitions. The file `sboz_baz_2008_orig` found in IHSN is not available elsewhere.

## Where can the data be found?

The data are **not publicly accessible** and have **strict access restrictions**. The World Bank received select years of KAZ LFS through collaboration with the ECA team. However, the team **has not shared more recent rounds** beyond 2013. Data users are encouraged to refer to the **[PRIMUS documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/worldbank/primus)** for additional metadata if working within the World Bank system.

## What is the sampling procedure?

A two-stage stratified sampling design is **assumed** for the LFS, at least for years **2012 and 2013**, although this is **not explicitly confirmed** in the survey documentation. Based on comparable Central Statistics Division (CSD) practices:
1. **Primary Sampling Units (PSUs)** (e.g., census tracts or enumeration areas) are selected in the first stage.
2. **Households** are selected within PSUs using systematic or simple random sampling.

No official **methodology reports** were provided alongside the datasets, limiting detailed knowledge of sampling procedures for earlier years.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The KAZ LFS is **nationally representative** and also representative at the **regional (oblast)** and **urban/rural** levels. However, definitions of urban and rural status follow **national administrative definitions**, which may not fully align with international (e.g., WDI) classifications.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Panel structure and identifiers

Although the survey is designed as a **rotating panel**, the household or individual **IDs do not remain consistent across years**. Within a given year, **order of visit** can often be inferred, allowing some within-year longitudinal tracking.

Efforts to construct panels (e.g., those by Donovan) did not include Kazakhstan, and inconsistencies in ID structures prevent reliable reconstruction of full panels from our datasets.

### Variable contamination and reconstruction

The dataset contains **residual variables constructed by previous users**, which were accidentally saved in the raw files. In some years, we had to rely on these harmonized versions where **original raw variables were missing**. As a general principle, we **avoid using reconstructed variables** unless strictly necessary. Labor force variables are typically preserved in their original form in the source datasets.

Examples of known issues:
- ISIC code `8900` should be `0890` (mining classification).
- Several inconsistencies exist in ISCO codings across years.

### Missing metadata and validation materials

There is **no survey report** that summarizes key variables or survey structure, and **no accompanying methodology note**. As such, we cannot confirm if our harmonization aligns with the original statistical agency definitions.
