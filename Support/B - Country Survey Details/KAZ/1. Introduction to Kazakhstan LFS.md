## What is the KAZ LFS survey?

The Kazakhstan Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a nationally representative household survey conducted by the **Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan**. It was first implemented in **2001** and has been carried out on a **quarterly basis** since then. The survey is officially designed to follow a **rotating panel** structure, although identifying the panel across quarters or years is not feasible due to inconsistencies in household identifiers.

## What does the KAZ LFS survey cover?

The LFS collects detailed information on **labor market status** and **demographic characteristics** for individuals **aged 15 and older** only. A separate **child labor module** was fielded in some years, but this module is **not available** in the World Bank datasets.

Below is a summary of sample sizes by year:

| Year | Persons | Households |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2009 | 208,173 | 74,031     |
| 2010 | 53,098  | 21,666     |
| 2011 | 103,499 | 42,164     |
| 2012 | 51,070  | 20,966     |
| 2013 | 49,800  | 21,045     |

In addition to standard labor force indicators (employment, unemployment, inactivity), the dataset includes:
- **Sector and occupation codes** (ISIC and ISCO)
- **Informality markers**
- **Working hours and underemployment**
- **Wage and income questions**

> Note: The employment and unemployment figures in the KAZ LFS **differ significantly from ILO-reported estimates**, often showing **much higher unemployment rates**. The source and construction method for these figures remain unclear. Further outreach to ILO contacts is ongoing to clarify this discrepancy.

> Also note: No data for 2008 could be harmonized due to missing documentation and unclear variable definitions. The file `sboz_baz_2008_orig` found in IHSN is not available elsewhere.

## Where can the data be found?

The data are **not publicly accessible** and have **strict access restrictions**. The World Bank received select years of KAZ LFS through collaboration with the ECA team. However, the team **has not shared more recent rounds** beyond 2013. Data users are encouraged to refer to the **[PRIMUS documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/worldbank/primus)** for additional metadata if working within the World Bank system.

## What is the sampling procedure?

A two-stage stratified sampling design is **assumed** for the LFS, at least for years **2012 and 2013**, although this is **not explicitly confirmed** in the survey documentation. Based on comparable Central Statistics Division (CSD) practices:
1. **Primary Sampling Units (PSUs)** (e.g., census tracts or enumeration areas) are selected in the first stage.
2. **Households** are selected within PSUs using systematic or simple random sampling.

No official **methodology reports** were provided alongside the datasets, limiting detailed knowledge of sampling procedures for earlier years.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The KAZ LFS is **nationally representative** and also representative at the **regional (oblast)** and **urban/rural** levels. However, definitions of urban and rural status follow **national administrative definitions**, which may not fully align with international (e.g., WDI) classifications.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Panel structure and identifiers

Although the survey is designed as a **rotating panel**, the household or individual **IDs do not remain consistent across years**. Within a given year, **order of visit** can often be inferred, allowing some within-year longitudinal tracking.

Efforts to construct panels (e.g., those by Donovan) did not include Kazakhstan, and inconsistencies in ID structures prevent reliable reconstruction of full panels from our datasets.

### Variable contamination and reconstruction

The dataset contains **residual variables constructed by previous users**, which were accidentally saved in the raw files. In some years, we had to rely on these harmonized versions where **original raw variables were missing**. As a general principle, we **avoid using reconstructed variables** unless strictly necessary. Labor force variables are typically preserved in their original form in the source datasets.

Examples of known issues:
- ISIC code `8900` should be `0890` (mining classification).
- Several inconsistencies exist in ISCO codings across years.

### Missing metadata and validation materials

There is **no survey report** that summarizes key variables or survey structure, and **no accompanying methodology note**. As such, we cannot confirm if our harmonization aligns with the original statistical agency definitions.
