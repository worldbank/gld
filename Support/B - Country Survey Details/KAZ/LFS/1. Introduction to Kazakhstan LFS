## What is the KAZ LFS survey?

The Kazakhstan Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a nationally representative household survey conducted by the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan. It was first implemented in 2001, and although we only have access to data from 2009 to 2013, the survey continues to be fielded.

The surveys for 2009 to 2013 are collected on a quarterly basis, and based on the repetition of person identifiers and consistency in individual characteristics across quarters, we believe the survey follows a rotating panel design. However, we have no official documentation to confirm this structure, and another panel harmonization effort ((Donovan, Lu and Schoellman, 2023)[https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/4/2287/7181328]) do not appear to include Kazakhstan LFS in their list of panel surveys.

## What does the KAZ LFS survey cover?

The LFS collects detailed information on **labor market status** and **demographic characteristics** for individuals **aged 15 and older**. There are no observations for 0 - 14 year old members of sampled households.

Below is a summary of sample sizes by year:

| Year | Persons | Households |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2009 | 208,173 | 85,920     |
| 2010 | 206,862 | 85,747     |
| 2011 | 203,821 | 83,820     |
| 2012 | 200,440 | 82,918     |
| 2013 | 196,073 | 83,670     |


## Where can the data be found?

The data are **not publicly accessible** and have **strict access restrictions**. The World Bank received select years of KAZ LFS through collaboration with the ECA team. However, the team has not shared more recent rounds beyond 2013.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The data appear to have been collected using a two-stage sampling design, although this has not been confirmed. The PSU variable is available for years 2012 and 2013.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The KAZ LFS is representative at the national-level. As we have no documentation, we cannot confirm whether data is representative at a lower administrative level.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Variable contamination and reconstruction

The dataset contains residual variables constructed by previous users, which were saved in the raw files -- whether this is accidental or intentional, we do not know. In some years, we had to rely on these harmonized versions where original raw variables were missing. As a general principle, we avoid using reconstructed variables unless there are no other options. Labor force variables are typically preserved in their original form in the source datasets.
