# Education Levels in Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan's education system is structured in sequential stages beginning with four years of primary education, typically starting at age 6 or 7. This is followed by five years of basic general education (Grades 5–9), forming a foundational cycle that all students complete. After Grade 9, students choose among three main tracks for upper secondary education.

The first is the academic track, known as general secondary education (_среднее общее образование_), which continues through Grade 11 or 12 and offers a broad, general curriculum. The second and third tracks are vocational. Initial vocational education, offered in lyceums or training schools, begins after basic education and is often shorter, focusing on specific occupational skills. In contrast, secondary professional colleges provide both academic and vocational instruction, typically over three or four years, and lead to a credential that qualifies students for either immediate employment or university entry.

Tertiary education includes bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs. Some students may attend but not complete higher education, exiting without a final credential. At the other end of the spectrum, some individuals never enter formal schooling or leave before completing early grades.

The table below summarizes how each of these levels aligns with the raw education codes from the Kazakhstan Labor Force Survey:
