## GLD Labor Force Estimations Compared to PCBS

GLD-coded estimates may differ from the absolute employment figures published by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). These variations typically arise from the GLD’s objective of cross-country harmonization. To document these differences, we provide a comparison table ([link here](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/blob/ad68d6a137af1023e23deb2d4f64d026ea2cc4b1/Support/B%20-%20Country%20Survey%20Details/PSE/LFS/utilities/table_lf.xlsx)) that aligns GLD labor categories (employed, unemployed, and out of the labor force) with official PCBS counts.

The primary source of divergence is the treatment of unemployment. The GLD applies a consistent definition following standard ILO protocols across all years. While the PCBS also follows these standards, their reporting occasionally incorporates specific underemployment definitions tailored to the local context that are not utilized in the GLD’s harmonized series.

Despite these differences in absolute counts, ratio-based indicators—specifically the **employment-to-working-age population** and **labor force participation rates**—remain broadly consistent between the two sources, showing no major deviations in trends over time.

Notably, both series capture a significant decline in 2002. This synchronized drop highlights the impact of external political shocks on the labor market during that period, reflecting the sensitivity of both methodologies to real-world conditions.
