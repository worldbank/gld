## GLD labor force estimations compared to PCBS
GLD-coded estimates differ slightly from the absolute employment numbers reported by PCBS. To document these discrepancies, we compiled a table that compares absolute employment counts across labor categories (e.g., employed, unemployed, not in labor force), showing the magnitude and direction of differences between GLD and PCBS.

GLD applies a consistent definition of unemployment across all years, following ILO standards. By contrast, PCBS introduces, in various years, an underemployment definition that is not uniformly considered in GLD. This methodological alignment on unemployment—and divergence on underemployment—can lead to differences between the GLD and PCBS series.

We also estimated two ratio-based indicators: employment-to-working-age population and employment-to-potential labor force. Both ratios are broadly consistent with PCBS-reported figures, exhibiting no major deviations over time.

Notably, both GLD and PCBS show a sharp decline in 2002 relative to adjacent years. We interpret this drop as likely reflecting external political shocks affecting the country’s labor market conditions during that period.
