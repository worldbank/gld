## What is the sampling procedure?

Before 2011, the sampling frame was designed independent of a census, which is typically the base of the labor force samploings. A two stage procedure using carefully designed sampling units were used. The sample includes all individuals aged 15 and above excluding prisioners and people living in shelters. The focus was the regions of West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The stratification had various levels, by district, by type of locality (municipalieies, villages and refugee camps=, by size of the locatity. The household are the sampling units in the decond stage, while on the first stage tje sampling units are the area units of the master sample.  Beofe 2011, the sample design prioritised target cluster size or sample take, for the numbers of household to be selected per PSU. In terms of rotation , the areas remained fixed over time but within each are a poportion of household is replaced each round. In the first stage a fixed sample of household is enumerated in two consecutive rounds and in the second phase the same household s rmain int he sample over six consecutive rounds.      
The sampling frame changed in 2011. Since 2011 the sample is two stages stratiefied in clusters. In the first stage the NSO selects 494 enumeration areas excluding enumeration areas with less than 40 households.  In the second stage, the NSO selects a systematic random sample of 16 household from each enumeration area with sizes of 80 household and over, for enumeration areas with less density 8 household were selected. The sample strata is formed of governorates and by urban and rural locations. The palestine state NSO also consider refugee camps as a separate region besides urban and rural and provides information of the population living there. 

The sample areas remained fixed througout the survey, however 50% of the of the EAs were replaced each round, with a pattern of twp consecutive interviews and then dropped and then being selected again for two consecutite rounds to be dropped completely after. 

## What is the geographic significance level?
