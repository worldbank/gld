## What is the PSE LFS?

The Palestine Labor Force Survey (PSE LFS) is conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and has been implemented since 1995. The survey provides essential data to inform policy, as well as to monitor and evaluate labor market trends in the State of Palestine.

## What does the PSE LFS cover?

The PSE LFS collects data on the labor force and its components, including employment, unemployment, and underemployment. It also gathers information on demographic characteristics, education, and the regional distribution of the population. The target population includes individuals aged 15 years and older residing within the State of Palestine.

## Where can the data be found?

The PSE LFS data is publicly available upon request through the PCBS National Statistical Office (NSO) repository website ([link here](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/PCBS-Metadata-en-v5.2/index.php/catalog/?page=1&collection%5B%5D=Employment-Unemployment&ps=100)), or by contacting the PCBS directly.

## What is the sampling procedure?

Prior to 2011, the sampling frame was designed independently of a census, using a two-stage procedure with carefully defined sampling units. The sample included individuals aged 15 and above, excluding prisoners and people living in shelters, and focused on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Stratification was conducted by district, type of locality (municipalities, villages, refugee camps), and locality size. Households were the sampling units in the second stage, while area units formed the master sample in the first stage. The sample design prioritized cluster size and the number of households selected per primary sampling unit (PSU). Areas remained fixed over time, but a proportion of households was replaced each round. In the first stage, a fixed sample of households was enumerated in two consecutive rounds, and in the second phase, the same households remained in the sample for six consecutive rounds.

Since 2011, the sample has been selected using a two-stage stratified cluster design. In the first stage, the NSO selects 494 enumeration areas, excluding those with fewer than 40 households. In the second stage, a systematic random sample of 16 households is selected from each enumeration area with 80 or more households; for areas with fewer households, 8 are selected. Sample strata are formed by governorates and by urban, rural, and refugee camp locations. Refugee camps are considered a separate region in addition to urban and rural areas, and the survey provides information on populations living there.

Sample areas remain fixed throughout the survey, but 50% of the enumeration areas are replaced each round, following a pattern of two consecutive interviews before being dropped, and then selected again for two consecutive rounds before being dropped completely.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The PSE LFS provides statistically significant estimates at the national and the sub-units of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

## Other Noteworthy Aspects 

### Change in sample size from quarter 3 2023 to date

Due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the survey has not been conducted in the Gaza Strip since the third quarter of 2023. As a result, data from 2023 onwards are representative only of the West Bank. This change has significantly reduced the number of observations and affected population estimates.

### Number of households in 2020

The number of households in 2020 is abnormally high. The GLD team is aiming to update the underlying raw data to address the issue. In the meantime users should be advised of potential errors in the household identification.

### Coding of `urban` variable

The `urban` variable denotes whether the setting the respondent resides in is either urban or rural (by the NSO's definition, note that these may vary between countries). In the context of PSE the variable has three options, namely "Urban", "Rural", and "Camp". The concept of "Camp" has been left as missing and users are kindly asked to decide themselves what category of `urban` (if any at all) those answers should be classified under.
