## What is the TJK HBS?

Household Budget Survey (HBS) represent a key area within socio-economic statistics, focusing primarily on assessing the populationâ€™s standard of living and material well-being. These surveys provide insight into the actual conditions and trends in income, expenditure, consumption, and savings across different population groups. This allows for the identification of disparities based on factors such as household age composition, sector of employment, and type of enterprise ownership

## What does the TJK HBS cover?

Through the Household Budget Survey (HBS), the Agency for Statistics of Tajikistan collects data on household expenditures, living conditions, and various household characteristics. By incorporating additional modules aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, the HBS also captures demographic indicators disaggregated by sex, age, education level, marital status, and other related variables.

The HBS in Tajikistan has been implemented continuously since the year 2000. However, the Global Labour Database (GLD) harmonization currently includes only the 2021 and 2022 rounds. Years and their corresponding sample sizes of HBS harmonized are:


| **Year** | **Households Interviewed**  | **Individuals Interviewed**   | **Expanded Population**   | **Official Sample Size (Households)**  |
|:--------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| 2021     | 12,000                      | 73,000                       | 10,582,026               | Not officially specified              |
| 2022     | 12,000                      | 72,280                       | 10,748,509               | Not officially specified              |


## Where can the data be found?

The data used in this project were shared with the Global Labour Database team by colleagues in the World Bank country office in Tajikistan. All data are classified as Official Use Only: they may be used internally within the World Bank but are not authorized for external distribution.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Household Budget Survey (HBS) in the country uses a clustered sampling design based on a probability proportional to size (PPS) approach. Clusters are distributed across geographic or administrative strata according to the number of households in each. The size and allocation of clusters are informed by both statistical guidelines and practical considerations related to fieldwork. Recent survey rounds have also used updated expenditure data to improve representativeness. For more information, please see this [Technical note.](utilities/Technical%20Note%20on%20HBS%202024%20Sampling.docx)

## What is the geographic significance level?

The Household Budget Survey (HBS) is designed to be representative at the regional level across the five main administrative divisions of the country (Dushanbe, Sogd, Khatlon, GBAO, and DRS), with results disaggregated by urban and rural areas. An exception is Dushanbe City, which is entirely urban and therefore does not include a rural stratum in the sampling design.

### Wages in Tajikistan
Both 2021 and 2022 show unusual patterns regarding paid employed salaries. For more details, please see [this document](Wages.md)

### Employment Questions Order and Impact on Results

This survey has a particular feature: the order of questions in the main activity section influences the results. Figure 1 displays the HBS 2021 and 2022 questions related to respondents' work activities. If they respond affirmatively to any of the questions used to determine employment status, they are directed to the employment section under the assumption that this is their main job.

Upon the first affirmative response that qualifies the individual as employed (e.g., answering 'yes' to Q1 or 'no' to Q4, as shown in the figure), the respondent is directed to provide information specifically about that job. It is not possible to know information about other types of work. Commonly, if the survey determines a person eligible to be asked about employment in various ways (i.e., they have various jobs) the enumerator asks about the job that the respondent devotes the most time to. Here the order determines the selection.

### Comparision with LFS 2016

The 2021 Household Budget Survey was conducted five years after the last Labor Force Survey. It is important to assess changes in the labor market between these two periods.

The figure below shows that, although the overall decline in employment compared to 2016 is not significant, there has been a substantial shift in the structure of employment by economic activity. Specifically, there is a noticeable decrease in employment in the agriculture sector, accompanied by increases in the industry sector and other types of activities. This shift is also associated with a significant occupational change, particularly an increase in the share of craft workers.

The GLD team has not identified a specific causal explanation for this phenomenon but highlights it as an important trend to consider in the analysis.

### Education System in Tajikistan

In Tajikistan, education is organized into three stages: basic education, secondary education, and tertiary education. The table below shows the average duration, in years, of each stage. This information is useful for creating the variable ```educy```, which codes the number of years spent in education, and the variable ```educat7```, which classifies the highest level of education attained by the respondent into seven categories.

| Education Level                                     | Years   | Observations                                   |
|:---------------------------------------------------:|:-------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
| Primary                                            | 6       |                                                |
| Junior High School (JSS1/JHS1)                      | 3       |                                                |

### HBS 2023
GLD has access to the 2023 Household Budget Survey; however, the results from our harmonization process show some discrepancies with the official report, and we have not yet been able to identify a clear explanation for them. As a result, the harmonization code for this version of the survey is not included in the official GLD release, but it can still be consulted [here](utilities/TJK_2023_HBS_V01_M_V01_A_GLD_ALL.do).
