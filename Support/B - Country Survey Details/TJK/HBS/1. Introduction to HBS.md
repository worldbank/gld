## What is the TJK HBS?

The Household Budget Survey (HBS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Agency for Statistics under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan (TAJSTAT). This survey has been responsible for providing statistics on household living conditions in Tajikistan. Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the HBS was implemented using Soviet methodology, collecting household consumption data from a fixed sample over time. Following the outbreak of civil war in the early 1990s, the survey was suspended and only partially resumed in 1997, covering three districts due to limited staff capacity. The HBS was fully reestablished in January 2000, and since then, data have been collected every quarter.

## What does the tjk HBS cover?

Through the Household Budget Survey (HBS), the Agency for Statistics of Tajikistan collects data on household expenditures, living conditions, and various household characteristics. By incorporating additional modules aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, the HBS also captures demographic indicators disaggregated by sex, age, education level, marital status, and other related variables.

e Household Budget Survey (HBS) in Tajikistan has been implemented continuously since the year 2000. However, the Global Labour Database (GLD) harmonization currently includes only the 2021 and 2022 rounds. Years and their corresponding sample sizes of HBS harmonized are:


| **Year** | **Households Interviewed**  | **Individuals Interviewed**   | **Expanded Population**   | **Official Sample Size (Households)**  |
|:--------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| 2021     | 12,000                      | 73,000                       | 10,582,026               | Not officially specified              |
| 2022     | 12,000                      | 72,280                       | 10,748,509               | Not officially specified              |


## Where can the data be found?

All the data is classified as Official Use Only: it may be used within the World Bank but is not authorized for external distribution.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The clustered sampling design follows a probability proportional to size (PPS) approach, allocating 204 clusters across 9 strata, proportionally to the total number of households in each stratum. The cluster size was determined based on both the recommendations from the Relative Standard Error (RSE) analysis conducted in 2015 and practical considerations related to data collection challenges within each stratum. The sampling strategy also incorporates per capita expenditure estimates from the 2021 HBS to refine allocation and ensure representativeness.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The HBS is representative at regional level across the five main administrative units, with separate data for urban and rural areas.

### Type of economic activity (usann OKVED)
To classify economic activity, the Tajikistan Labour Force Survey (HBS TJK) uses the OKVED (Russian Classification of Types of Economic Activity), which is aligned with the NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) up to the 4-digit level. The 5th and 6th digits of OKVED refer to country-specific activities. The following table presents a correspondence between the relevant classification versions (all mappings are at the 4-digit level).

| **OKVED**   | **NACE**   | **ISIC**   |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Rev 1.1     | Rev 1.1    | Rev 3.1    |
| Rev 2       | Rev 2      | Rev 4      |


### Employment Questions Order and Impact on Results

This survey has a special feature, the order of the questions in the main activity section matters. Figure 1 displays HBS 2009 and 2016 questions related to the activities performed by respondents. If they answer affirmatively to any of these questions, they are directed to the employment-related section under the assumption that this is their main job.

| HBS 2009          |  HBS 2016 |

This occurs in all cases. Upon the first affirmative response, the individual is specifically asked about that job. It is not possible to know information about other types of work. Commonly, if the survey determines a person eligible to be asked about employment in various ways (i.e., they have various jobs) the enumerator asks about the job that the respondent devotes the most time to. Here the order determines the selection.


### Weight Variable Selection – HBS 2016

The HBS 2016 raw data includes several weight variables. To determine the most appropriate one, we conducted the following analysis

First, we reviewed the dataset that includes all individuals. Figure 2 shows the total population using the weights from the full individual-level datase.

</figure>

According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), Tajikistan's population in 2016 was approximately 8.8 million (see Figure 3). This suggests that the variables ```weight``` and ```weightFinal``` from the full dataset closely reflect the national population.

</figure>

Next, we analyzed the questionnaire dataset, which only includes individuals aged 12 to 75 (the target population for the HBS). Figure 4 shows the population totals using weights from this dataset. For comparison, Figure 5 shows the same calculation using the full individual-level data restricted to the 12–75 age group. The questionnaire dataset includes slightly more individuals and shows a lower average weight. Also, iIn the full dataset, the average values of ```weight``` and ```weightfinal``` differ slightly. In the questionnaire dataset, their averages are exactly the same.

</figure>

We selected ```weightfinal``` from the questionnaire dataset as the main weight variable. When individuals were missing from that dataset, we completed the weights using ```weightFinal``` from the full data file.

### Education System in tjkna

In tjkna, education is organized into three stages: basic education, secondary education, and tertiary education. The table below illustrates the average duration in years of each stage. This information is useful for creating the variable educy, that codes the number of years spent in education and the variable educat7, that classifies the highest level of education attained by the respondent to seven levels.
