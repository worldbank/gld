## What is the TJK LFS?

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Agency for Statistics of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan (TAJSTAT).There have been three editions of the survey, with the most recent conducted in 2016 in collaboration with the World Bank.

## What does the tjk LFS cover?

The TJK LFS findings provide annual labour market statistical indicators. The LFS targets individuals aged 12 to 75 years (working age population) and collects detailed information on their employment status, job characteristics, and economic activities during a reference week. It provides essential insights into the structure and dynamics of the workforce, including indicators of employment, unemployment, underemployment, and labour force participation.

The survey focuses on private households and excludes collective or institutional households such as retirement homes, military barracks, and prisons. It is conducted through face-to-face interviews based on a household questionnaire.

There are three official versions of the TJK LFS: conducted in 2004, 2009, and 2016. However, the Global Labour Database (GLD) harmonization currently includes only the 2009 and 2016 rounds.Years and their corresponding sample sizes of LFS harmonized are:


| **Year** | **Households Interviewed** | **Individuals Interviewed**  | **Expanded Population**  | **Official Sample Size (Households)** |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| 2009     | 4,937                      | 17,177                       | 5,228,669                | Not officially specified              |
| 2016     | 4,080                      | 24,997                       | 5,228,669                | 4,080                                 |


## Where can the data be found?

All the data is classified as Official Use Only: it may be used within the World Bank but is not authorized for external distribution.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The TJK LFS employs a two-stage stratified random sampling design. In the first stage, 272 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were selected using probability proportional to size, based on the 2010 census enumeration areas. In the second stage, 15 households and 5 replacements were randomly selected within each PSU from an updated household listing. The total sample included 4,080 households (1,440 urban and 2,640 rural), ensuring national and regional representativeness across five administrative regions, with separate coverage for urban and rural areas. The sampling structure was aligned with the 2009 LFS to support temporal comparisons

## What is the geographic significance level?

The LFS is representative at regional level across the five main administrative units, with separate data for urban and rural areas.

### Type of economic activity (usann OKVED)
To classify economic activity, the Tajikistan Labour Force Survey (LFS TJK) uses the OKVED (Russian Classification of Types of Economic Activity), which is aligned with the NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) up to the 4-digit level. The 5th and 6th digits of OKVED refer to country-specific activities. The following table presents a correspondence between the relevant classification versions (all mappings are at the 4-digit level).

| **OKVED**   | **NACE**   | **ISIC**   |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Rev 1.1     | Rev 1.1    | Rev 3.1    |
| Rev 2       | Rev 2      | Rev 4      |


### Employment Questions Order and Impact on Results

This survey has a special feature, the order of the questions in the main activity section matters. Figure 1 displays LFS 2009 and 2016 questions related to the activities performed by respondents. If they answer affirmatively to any of these questions, they are directed to the employment-related section under the assumption that this is their main job.

| LFS 2009          |  LFS 2016 |

This occurs in all cases. Upon the first affirmative response, the individual is specifically asked about that job. It is not possible to know information about other types of work. Commonly, if the survey determines a person eligible to be asked about employment in various ways (i.e., they have various jobs) the enumerator asks about the job that the respondent devotes the most time to. Here the order determines the selection.


### Weight Variable Selection – LFS 2016

The LFS 2016 raw data includes several weight variables. To determine the most appropriate one, we conducted the following analysis

First, we reviewed the dataset that includes all individuals. Figure 2 shows the total population using the weights from the full individual-level datase.

</figure>

According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), Tajikistan's population in 2016 was approximately 8.8 million (see Figure 3). This suggests that the variables ```weight``` and ```weightFinal``` from the full dataset closely reflect the national population.

Next, we analyzed the questionnaire dataset, which only includes individuals aged 12 to 75 (the target population for the LFS). Figure 4 shows the population totals using weights from this dataset. For comparison, Figure 5 shows the same calculation using the full individual-level data restricted to the 12–75 age group. The questionnaire dataset includes slightly more individuals and shows a lower average weight. Also, iIn the full dataset, the average values of ```weight``` and ```weightfinal``` differ slightly. In the questionnaire dataset, their averages are exactly the same.

</figure>

We selected ```weightfinal``` from the questionnaire dataset as the main weight variable. When individuals were missing from that dataset, we completed the weights using ```weightFinal``` from the full data file.


### ICLS 13 en 2009 pero es medio de versión de 19 (ver reporte - creo que hay que corregir eso, poner el de icls 13 estricto y poner codigos para version pais y version 19)



### Education System in tjkna

In tjkna, education is organized into three stages: basic education, secondary education, and tertiary education. The table below illustrates the average duration in years of each stage. This information is useful for creating the variable educy, that codes the number of years spent in education and the variable educat7, that classifies the highest level of education attained by the respondent to seven levels.
