## What is the TJK LFS?

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Agency for Statistics of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan (TAJSTAT).There have been three editions of the survey, with the most recent conducted in 2016 in collaboration with the World Bank.

## What does the TJK LFS cover?

The Labour Force Survey provides annual labour market statistical indicators. It targets individuals aged 12 to 75 years (the working-age population) and collects detailed information on their employment status, job characteristics, and economic activities during a reference week. It offers essential insights into the structure and dynamics of the workforce, including indicators of employment, unemployment, underemployment, and labour force participation.

The survey focuses on private households and excludes collective or institutional households such as retirement homes, military barracks, and prisons. It is conducted through face-to-face interviews using a household questionnaire.

There are three official versions of the TJK LFS: conducted in 2004, 2009, and 2016. However, the Global Labour Database (GLD) harmonization currently includes only the 2009 and 2016 rounds. The years and their corresponding sample sizes of the harmonized LFS are:


| **Year** | **Households Interviewed** | **Individuals Interviewed**  | **Expanded Population**  | **Official Sample Size (Households)** |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| 2009     | 4,937                      | 17,177                       | 5,228,669                | Not officially specified              |
| 2016     | 4,080                      | 24,997                       | 8,646,932               | 4,080                                 |

The large increase in the expanded population between 2009 and 2016 is partly due to a difference in age coverage: the available 2009 data cover individuals aged 12 and older, while the 2016 data include all ages.

## Where can the data be found?

The data used in this project were shared with the Global Labour Database team by colleagues in the World Bank country office in Tajikistan. All data are classified as Official Use Only: they may be used internally within the World Bank but are not authorized for external distribution.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Labor Force Survey (LFS) in Tajikistan uses a two-stage, stratified random sampling approach to ensure that results are representative at both the national and regional levels. First, areas across the country are selected based on their population size. Then, within each selected area, a random sample of households is chosen from an updated list. The survey covers both urban and rural regions separately, and the sampling design is structured to allow for comparisons over time.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is designed to be representative at the regional level across the five main administrative divisions of the country (Dushanbe, Sogd, Khatlon, GBAO, and DRS), with results disaggregated by urban and rural areas. An exception is Dushanbe City, which is entirely urban and therefore does not include a rural stratum in the sampling design.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Type of economic activity
To classify economic activity, the Tajikistan Labour Force Survey uses the OKVED (Russian Classification of Types of Economic Activity), which is aligned with the NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) up to the 4-digit level. The 5th and 6th digits of OKVED refer to country-specific activities. The 2009 LFS used OKVED Rev 1.1, while the 2016 LFS used OKVED Rev 2. The following table presents a correspondence between the relevant classification versions:

| **OKVED**   | **NACE**   | **ISIC**   |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Rev 1.1     | Rev 1.1    | Rev 3.1    |
| Rev 2       | Rev 2      | Rev 4      |

NACE and ISIC have a perfect correspondence at the 2-digit level. From the 3 and 4 digit levels, adjustments are required. For this purpose, the GLD team made a [correspondence table](utilities/NACE_to_ISIC.xlsx), showing the specific changes made to move from NACE to ISIC.


### Employment Questions Order and Impact on Results

This survey has a special feature, the order of the questions in the main activity section matters. Figure 1 displays LFS 2009 and 2016 questions related to the activities performed by respondents. If they answer affirmatively to any of these questions, they are directed to the employment-related section under the assumption that this is their main job.


<div align="center"><strong>Figure 1: LFS current Activity questions</strong></div>

| LFS 2009          |  LFS 2016 |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|

Upon the first affirmative response, the individual is specifically asked about that job. It is not possible to know information about other types of work. Commonly, if the survey determines a person eligible to be asked about employment in various ways (i.e., they have various jobs) the enumerator asks about the job that the respondent devotes the most time to. Here the order determines the selection.

### Origin of the 2009 LFS

Upon reviewing the 2009 data, no official report could be found, as expected. Furthermore, according to ILOSTAT, labor force participation for that year is not reported under a labor force survey (LFS). Instead, the 2008 round is labeled as an LFS, while 2009 is categorized as a [living standards survey](https://rshiny.ilo.org/dataexplorer69/?lang=en&segment=indicator&id=EAP_DWAP_SEX_AGE_RT_A) (see image below). This discrepancy raises questions about the true nature and methodology of the 2009 survey.

While some annual data are available on the Tajikistan official statistics [website](http://data.stat.tj/Home/index2/14?lang=en), the source and classification of these figures remain unclear. Notably, the values reported on the national site do not match those published by ILO, further highlighting inconsistencies in the data. Given these uncertainties, it is important to acknowledge the lack of clarity regarding the origin and classification of the 2009 survey data.


### Weight Variable Selection – LFS 2016

The LFS 2016 raw data includes several weight variables. To determine the most appropriate one, we conducted the following analysis.

First, we reviewed the dataset that includes all individuals. Figure 2 shows the total population using the weights from the full individual-level dataset.

<div align="center"><strong>Figure 3: Total Population - Persons data</strong></div>

<figure>

</figure>

According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), Tajikistan's population in 2016 was approximately 8.8 million (see Figure 3). This suggests that the variables ```weight``` and ```weightFinal``` from the full dataset closely reflect the national population.

<div align="center"><strong>Figure 4: Total Population - WDI</strong></div>

<figure>

</figure>

Next, we analyzed the questionnaire dataset, which includes only individuals aged 12 to 75—the target population for the LFS. Figure 4 shows the population totals using weights from this dataset. For comparison, Figure 5 shows the same calculation using the full individual-level dataset, restricted to the 12–75 age group.

The questionnaire dataset includes slightly more individuals and displays a lower average weight. Additionally, in the full dataset, the average values of ```weight``` and ```weightfinal``` differ slightly, whereas in the questionnaire dataset, their averages are exactly the same.

<figure>

<img src="utilities/raw_ind_weights_12to75_2016.PNG" alt="raw_ind_weights_12to75_2016"/>

</figure>

We selected ```weightfinal``` from the questionnaire dataset as the main weight variable. For individuals missing from that dataset, we filled in the weights using ```weightFinal``` from the full individual-level dataset.


### How recode to ICLS-19

The 2009 Labour Force Survey follows the ICLS-13 classification, while the 2016 round adopts the updated ICLS-19 standards. For more details on the changes introduced in ICLS-19,please see [here on the ILO website](https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/description-work-statistics-icls19/).

Although it is not feasible to revert the 2016 data to the earlier classification, it is possible to align the 2009 data with the ICLS-19 framework. To ensure comparability between both rounds, selected adjustments can be made to the employment coding, supported by the questionnaire structure. The specific harmonization procedures are detailed in a separate [document.](icls13to19.md) 


### Education System in Tajikistan

In Tajikistan, education is organized into three stages: basic education, secondary education, and tertiary education. The table below shows the average duration, in years, of each stage. This information is useful for creating the variable ```educy```, which codes the number of years spent in education, and the variable ```educat7```, which classifies the highest level of education attained by the respondent into seven categories.

| Education Level                                     | Years   | Observations                                   |
